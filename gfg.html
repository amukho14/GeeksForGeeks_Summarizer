     <strong>
      Coding questions:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1) Given two words, find if second word is the round rotation of first word.
     <span id="more-131878">
     </span>
     <br/>
     For example: abc, cab
     <br/>
     return 1
     <br/>
     since cab is round rotation of abc
    </p><p>
     Example2: ab, aa
     <br/>
     return -1
     <br/>
     since aa is not round rotation for aa
    </p><p>
     2) Given two hexadecimal numbers find if they can be consecutive in gray code
     <br/>
     For example: 10001000, 10001001
     <br/>
     return 1
     <br/>
     since they are successive in gray code
    </p><p>
     Example2: 10001000, 10011001
     <br/>
     return -1
     <br/>
     since they are not successive in gray code.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Aptitude questions:
     </strong>
    </p><p>

     </strong>
     <br/>
     1. You have given n point in a coordinate system.What you have to do is to find minimum k distance  point from origin.
     <br/>
     Sol i have given the  solution using insertion sort .i have taken a array of size n and while calculating the distance, entering the distance  in the array in sorted fashion.
     <br/>
     second solution i have given using heap,  storing the first k distance in heap, then iterating the n-k element.
    </p><p>
     2. Print the tree in zig-zag traversal
    </p><p>
     3. U have given large stream  of m size and  you have size of n window . you  have to find the k minimum in each window . we are shifting the window by one at every iteration.
     <br/>
     sol: I have used self balancing tree.First i have entered n element in tree and do in order traversal upto k to find k minimum element.Now shift the window by one          .Now we to remove first element(logn  time req)  and insert the new element(logn time). Initially i was thinking for solution using  big extra space which was not accepted by the interviewer. Assume for every question they asked what if you have 10 million data so your approach will  fail if you have taken extra o(n) space.Code should be scalable enough
    </p><p>
     4. N process can write at time in buffer and n process can read through  buffer.Design a system for read and write.
    </p><p>
     5.  words are coming through a stream , u have to halt the problem when first repeated words appear.
     <br/>
     Used  trie data structure.
    </p><p>
     6. N words are given.u have one source word and one destination word .u have reach to destination in minimum edit with the constraint that intermediate word should be from the words given.i have given the solution using graph and used BFS traversal .complexity discussion
    </p><p>
     7. what happen when u hit url .I have tried to explain it using Django, he is expecting something from domain name server.  Be prepared
    </p><p>
     Complexity concept should be clear(Recursive+iterative both)
     <br/>

     <br/>
     Coding Questions:
     <br/>
     1. In one of Amazon fulfillment centers, there are   a no. of empty boxes kept in increasing order in a row. Kiva robots are designed to put a product in a box. The product size is given. Design a program to find the best fit box for given product size. First line contains no. of empty boxes and next line contains size of boxes with space. The next line contains size of given product. The output shows the best fit box size and -1 otherwise.
    </p><p>
     2. You have to find a string in two-dimensional array. The input contains 2-D array of characters and given string. You can move in one of eight directions . The output contains location of first letter of string if string found completely, otherwise return -1. Any one out of multiple answers is accepted, if possible.
     <br/>
     For example, Input:
     <br/>
     b	t	g

     <br/>
     Brief introduction about myself and my project.
     <br/>
     1. Given an array of positive and negative integers, rearrange positive and negative numbers in 0(n) time .
     <br/>
     First, I solved it using 2 arrays,each for positive and negative integers and place elements of array in these 2 arrays and them combine them back by taking one element from each array. Then he told me to do without extra space. I then segregated positive and negative elements using quicksort .Below is the link:

     then he asked me to write the code…
    </p><p>
     2-&gt;What is the diameter of a tree?
     <br/>
     I answered…
     <br/>
     then he asked me to write the complete code…
    </p><p>
     3-&gt;He asked me a design problem "you have to design a class "DeckofCards"…with 2 operations: 1:Shuffle 2:Pick"
     <br/>
     Pick would pick a random card from the deck and Shuffle will shuffle the cards and give you back the deck of cards.
     <br/>
     I answered with 2 options 1.LinkedList 2:Array…then there was a discussion around 15 mins over both the solutions…
    </p><p>

Considering each meeting invite as an object and that Web server is the storage space for the invites, design a data structure to receive and send invites to user in an efficient manner. The message objects must be received in a sorted manner based on the time of meeting. I gave an O(NlogN) solution and he was pretty impressed. I was then asked to code it.
     <br/>
     3. An array is given whose every ith index is the child node of a[i] as shown in the example below. The root node is represented by -1. Find the height of the tree.I did it in linear time.

     <br/>
     1. Cultural info and projects discussion. What errors have you performed in your career path? What are the major challenges that you faced?…and other such questions.
     <br/>
     2. Design a parking lot system. She was very much concerned with all the edge cases.
     <br/>
     3. How would detect whether a singly linked list is a palindrome or not?I gave a solution with O(n) time and space complexity. But she asked to optimize it further with O(1) space complexity.

     </span>
     which would play songs randomly in your device (unique song_id) and code it.
     <br/>
     After i gave him a solution with hash function , he asked me to improve the algorithm such that once a song is played it should be played only when all the other songs are played,
     <br/>
     Solutions Complexity : Space – O(n) , Time – O(1)  ;  n—&gt; number of songs
     <br/>
     After that he asked me to improve my solution and do it without using extra space.
     <br/>
     Solutions Complexity : Space – O(1) , Time – O(n) ; n—&gt;number of songs
     <br/>
     Hint : Maintain indices and once a song is played shift it in range of played songs index.

      <strong>
       problem
      </strong>
     </span>
     we face if we store the value of the linked list in an integer or long if the number of digits were above certain limits in the non-recursive function.

     <strong>
      Round 2 F2F :(Duration – 1 hr)
     </strong>
    </p><p>

    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Q1
     </strong>
     – Find the
     <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
      <strong>
       largest subtree which is binary search tree in a given Binary Tree
      </strong>
     </span>
     . Then to optimise it and then asked me to code it.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Q2
     </strong>
     – Given a linked list with a next pointer and an arbitrary pointer pointing to any node in the list ,

      <strong>
       copy the linked list
      </strong>
     </span>
     .
    </p><p>
     After i gave him a solution which changed the links of the initial linked list, he asked me to do without changing the links.
    </p><p>
     So i gave him a O(n^2) solution . He asked me to give another way or optimise my solution.He helped me to figure out the solution.
    </p><p>
     Hint – Hash map.
    </p><p>
     The interviewers were really helping and supporting and were more interested in seeing the efforts you make and the way you get to the logic.They help throughout by giving hints.

     1) Given a phone number. Check whether it is unique or not(ie no duplicates)
     <br/>
     I gave a o(n^2) TC algo first which he wanted to optimize. After 3 series of optimization ,I came up with a  o(n) solution with o(1) space complexity.
    </p><p>
     2) The interviewer told me to code a level order traversal in a binary tree.
    </p><p>
     3) An array of numbers are given such that the absolute difference between adjacent elements is 1.Given a value…Return the index of the 1st occurrence of that element.
     <br/>
     I gave an solution where in the 1st value is subtracted from the search value and hops in the array by that difference. if the reached value is the search value ,then return the index or just continue this process. The interviewer was impressed by my solution and told me to code it.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      <br/>
      F2F-2:

     <br/>
     1) Brief discussion of work in current company
    </p><p>
     2) A given  array represents a tree in such a way that the array value gives the parent node of that particular index.The value of the root node index would always be -1.Find the height of the tree.
    </p><p>
     I gave a iterative solution which was told to be optimized. I did optimize it using memorization concept. I had to code it too.
    </p><p>
     3) Write a program to find the median of 2 sorted arrays when merged.
    </p><p>
     This problem is there in geeksforgeeks.

     I attended an interview with Amazon for SDET-I position, about a month back. I did not clear the interview, but I would like thank GeeksforGeeks for the great learning period before the interview.
     <span id="more-131651">
     </span>
     GeeksforGeeks helped a real lot in my interview preparation and in general, my understanding of data structures and algorithms got deeper and stronger. Thank you very much GeeksforGeeks and all your valuable contributors!
    </p><p>
     Here is my interview experience:
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Telephonic 1:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1.	Given an array and a number, check whether there are any 3 elements in the array which add up to the given number.
     <br/>
     For example:
     <br/>
     Given an array {1,2,3,4,5}  and the number 9, return true, as 2,3,4 add up to 9.
     <br/>
     Given an array {1,2,3,4,5}  and the number 3, return false, as there are no 3 elements which add up to 3, in the array.
     <br/>
     2.	Given a number, find the nearest perfect square(modified binary search)
     <br/>
     For example:
     <br/>
     Given 50, return 49
     <br/>
     Given 25, return 25
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Telephonic 2:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1. Write a method to check whether two binary trees are mirrors of each other
     <br/>
     <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/foldable-binary-trees/" target="_blank">
      http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/foldable-binary-trees/
     </a>
    </p><p>
     2.	Write a method to print the boundaries of a binary tree
     <br/>
     <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/boundary-traversal-of-binary-tree/" target="_blank">
      http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/boundary-traversal-of-binary-tree/

    </p><p>
     <strong>
      F2F 1:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1. Fill an array with the next greater elements (using stack)
     <br/>
     <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/next-greater-element/" target="_blank">
      http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/next-greater-element/
     </a>
    </p><p>
     2. Given a binary tree, count the number of occurrences where there are two nodes with the same horizontal distance. To make it clearer, if we assume each node in a cell of a matrix, then count the number of occurrences when there is a collision of two nodes in the same cell.
     <br/>

     </a>
    </p><p>
     Here the count is 1 because 5 and 6 occupy the same cell in the matrix
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      F2F 2:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1. Given a linked list, write a program to check if it is a palindrome
     <br/>
     2. Write some test methods for stress testing of Furniture class
     <br/>
     3. Some discussion on automation testing
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      <br/>
      F2F 3: (System automation design)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     System: The user gives a book id to be downloaded and the location in which the book is to be stored. The system downloads the book (if it exists) in the location given by the user and returns a url through which the user can access the book.
     <br/>
     I was asked to design automated test cases for the system. The interviewer kept adding more and more constraints to the system and we discussed about the pros and cons of my approach.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Hiring Manager:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1.	Discussion about my current job role
     <br/>
     2.	Several behavioral and team fit questions
     <br/>
     3.	What are the things you will consider (both from Developers perspective and User perspective) while trying to develop an application for computer aided competitive examinations like CAT, GMAT etc.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      <br/>
      Bar Raiser:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1.	Given a singly linked list, write a recursive method to reverse every 3 nodes in the list.
     <br/>
     I did not write a clean code for this. He moved on because of lack of time.
     <br/>
     2.	Again discussion of my current job role and about the projects I have worked on.
     <br/>
     3.	Tell me 3 things that you want to learn/change in yourself
     <br/>
     4.	Again several team fit questions.

       </h2><p>
     <strong>
      Online round:
     </strong>
     In this round there were 20 MCQs to solve and 2 coding question.
     <span id="more-131017">
     </span>
     Of the 20MCQs a couple of questions were on Quantitative aptitude, relationships, OS, DBMS, Data structures etc. there was negative marking for every wrong answer so I attempted only 15 for which I was sure.
    </p><p>
     Q1- find the first non repeating character in a string.
    </p><p>
     Q2- given a binary tree where each node has some weight. You have to return the max weight in the binary tree.
    </p><p>
     Maxweight = value of root node + value in its left subtree and right subtree.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      1st round(50 mins):

     <strong>
      Online Round
     </strong>
     <br/>
     In this round there were 20 MCQs to solve and 2 coding question. Of the 20MCQs a couple of questions were on Quantitative aptitude, relationships, OS, DBMS, Data structures etc. there was negative marking for every wrong answer so I attempted only 15 for which I was sure.

     After this round 33 students were selected for face 2 face round.
     <img alt=":-D" class="wp-smiley" src="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif"/>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 1 F2F (40-50 mins)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Q1 – given a binary tree where the left subtree is mirror image of right subtree. So you have to check whether the tree is symmetric or not (structure wise). O(n)
    </p><p>
     Q2 – given a sorted 2D matrix and you are given a value you have to search that value in the matrix. I gave him two solutions. O(row + col)
    </p><p>
     Q3 – given two arrays in sorted form. The first array has some empty space equal to the size of second array at its end. You have to merge both array in the
     <u>
      <strong>
       smartest possible
      </strong>
     </u>
     way in the first array. With constraint that auxiliary space O(1).
    </p><p>
     Ex – arr1[9] = {2,4,5,7,8,_,_,_,_};
     <br/>
     arr2[4] = {3,6,8,9};
     <br/>
     after merging arr1 should be = {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,8,9};
    </p><p>
     For every question I was asked to write a working code with all corner cases handled. I impressed the interviewer very much in this round :). Then I ask him some questions like – how an intern contribute to the amazons claim to be the most customer centric company and a few more.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      <br/>
      Round 2 F2F (70–80 mins)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     This interview was with a senior guy.
     <br/>
     Q1 – Given a very large n-ary tree. Where the root node has some information which it wants to pass to all of its children down to the leaves with the constraint that it can only pass the information to one of its children at a time (take it as one iteration). Now in the next iteration the child node can transfer that information to only one of its children and at the same time instance the childs parent i.e. root can pass the info to one of its remaining children. Continuing in this way we have to find the minimum no of iterations required to pass the information to all nodes in the tree.
    </p><p>
     Minimum no of iterations for tree below is 6. Consider passing root information first to any child except A-B answer will come more then 7. So 6 is the minimum answer.
     <br/>
     <a href="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/amazon.png">
      <img alt="amazon" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-130997" height="242" src="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/amazon-300x242.png" width="300"/>
     </a>
    </p><p>
     I gave many approaches for this question but he was not satisfied with any approach. I said I will try to do it in a binary tree then I will generalize it for n-ary tree. He said your binary tree approach is correct but the way you are generalizing it to n-ary is wrong. The interviewer gave me many hints and said you have almost solved the question but missing a single point which I was not able to find till the end. Finally he moved to other question.
    </p><p>
     Q2- given a binary tree you have to check whether it is BST or not.
     <br/>
     This question was very easy. I solved it within minutes (one inorder traversal approach O(n)) but to my surprise the interviewer was saying it is wrong. I explained to him but again he said it is wrong. His motive was to pressurize me but I stick with my solution and finally he moved to other question. My answer was correct.
    </p><p>
     Q3 – given a BST find the Nth maximum and Nth minimum element.
     <br/>
     I solved it in O(n). He was fine with it but he said do it in logarithmic time. I did it too with some preprocessing and coded both the approaches.
    </p><p>
     Overall it was a very nice experience interviewing with them.

<h2>
        Amazon Interview | Set 124 (On-Campus)
       </h2><p>
     Hello friends, recently amazon visited our campus selecting 2 FTE and 7 interns for different roles.
     <span id="more-131281">
     </span>
     <br/>
     I would like to say about rejections. Ive got rejected in many companies (even in Amazon) but finally got placed in a good company. So be strong, there is always a door opened for us.
    </p><p>
     Here I share my experience with amazon.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 1:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Around 500 people attended this round. As usual 20 MCQ and 2 programming questions.
     <br/>
     We need to do at least one programming question to get through this round.
     <br/>
     MCQs include various topics like OOPS, OS, CN, DBMS etc.
     <br/>
     Two coding questions were:
     <br/>
     1. Merge two linked lists of different size such that nodes from each list are arranged alternatively.
    </p><p>
     2. Finding the minimum difference (I forgot the actual question).
    </p><p>
     59 people got shortlisted in this round.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 2:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Its a group fly round and people are divided into groups and asked to sit in different class rooms.
     <br/>
     We were given a question in a paper. Here everyone got a standard question. The question which I got was "Finding the largest contiguous sub array, start and end indexes must be printed with sum " (kadenesalgo).
     <br/>
     My friends got questions like "Boundary traversal" etc.
     <br/>
     So, This round is very simple and if you are strong in standard problems, you can clear it with ease.
     <br/>
     29 got shortlisted to next round.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 3:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     It was very simple for me because we were running out of time. Only one question was asked.
     <br/>
     "Find the kth element from the end in a SLL "
     <br/>
     Different approaches were discussed and he asked me to code for the best one.
     <br/>
     19 got shortlisted to next round.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 4:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     It was one of toughest round for me. I was very much interested in SDE role but I was interviewed for SE/QAE role. I dint dare to ask the interviewer about the role. We are not said before the interview that they are going to interview for that roles. I mean it is in their hands to decide the role that matches your skills.
     <br/>
     Questions were a bit tough for me in this round because am not much good in troubleshooting and testing. And this round went almost for 1 hr 30 mins.
    </p><p>
     Questions:
     <br/>
     1. Given start and finish times of a youtube video and how do you confirm that the video is completely watched by the user or not? I gave a solution, we can set flags when the user watches a particular unit of video. He asked me how discrete? I said it may be in terms of seconds. He then asked me, If a user is just watching in terms of microseconds?  I was not able to give the right answer. He was not satisfied with my solution.
     <img alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" src="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif"/>
    </p><p>
     2. A web application is running. We have only a text box. If we enter a name in the text box, we get the details of the person whose name is entered. Now the question is to troubleshoot the application when it stopped displaying the results after entering a name( whose details are present in the data base).
     <br/>
     I answered many points here, like server is disconnected and there may be locks on the details such that only one user can access the data at a time. And many other, but he was not much satisfied.
    </p><p>
     3. Give the test cases for the Gmail login page. At first I got tensed on hearing this question but I answered well. I almost gave 10 test cases quickly but, the interviewer want to extract as many he can. So he started noting down all the points which I said and kept asking me further points. Finally 25 – 30 test cases were covered.
    </p><p>
     4. Given a video whose audio is not playing in a video player. Troubleshoot.
     <br/>
     I gave many answers here. Like, there may be two major possibilities here. 1. The video may have some problem 2. The video player software may have some problem. Then I gave many points in each category. Like OS dependent etc. He was satisfied with my answers.
    </p><p>
     5. And 2 more questions were asked (I forgot ) They were from testing and troubleshooting.
    </p><p>
     14 got shortlisted to next round.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 5: (Hr + Tech )
     </strong>
     <br/>
     This was the round which I dint get through.
     <img alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" src="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif"/>
     <br/>
     First, Tell me about yourself. I request everyone to be well prepared for this question in any interview. It looks so simple, but its very difficult to impress the interviewer with your answer here.
     <br/>
     Next was a question from trees. Find the vertical sum in Binary tree. I said Ive done it before and I know the solution. He asked me to go ahead. Then I answered the same thing which was given in GFG. He then asked me to do it in a single traversal. I gave another solution but it also took 2 traversals. He scolded me that it is also taking 2 traversals. I was not able to think anymore after this. But it was very simple one. ?
     <br/>
     Next he asked me to find the duplicate chars in a infinite length stream of chars. I gave a hashmap solution and he asked me about hashmaps. He then extended the question that we have Integers also. Even then I said hashmap solution suits. He asked me about collisions here. He asked me how much size of hashmap you need?. And also about the range of elements that can be mapped? I answered well all these questions because Ive read a lot about hashmaps.
     <br/>
     Next he asked me a troubleshooting question. I answered this like the one which I faced in the previous round.
     <br/>
     Next he asked me "what happens during withdrawal of cash from ATM "? (only during withdrawal ?)
     <br/>
     I was not able to convince him with my answers. He was expecting a lot in terms of internal clocks and stuff in ATM.
     <br/>
     Next He asked me "what happens when you enter an URL in a web Browser "?
     <br/>
     I read this question in many interview experiences, so I answered it well But, He asked few questions in between. Like what is HTTPS? What does ‘S stands for in ‘HTTPS?
     <br/>
     And finally I was in a trap by this final question. What is a Web server? I really dont know. But I dared to answer, But to my bad luck I answered DNS server instead of Web server. He was very much angry with my answer and asked am bluffing? GONE
     <img alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" src="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif"/>
     <br/>
     All the impression was gone by just one simple mistake of mine and I dint get through.
     <br/>
     Finally 9 people got offers out of 14.
     <br/>
     2 were FTE and 7 were given INTERN.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      TIPS:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     If you are aiming for AMAZON then just try to solve as many questions as possible in GFG.
     <br/>
     Try to be frank in the interview. If you dont know the answer, Just accept that you dont know.
     <br/>
     Finally be Strong. Rejections are inevitable unless you are very cautious.
     <br/>
     I hope this will help others.
    </p><p>
     ALL THE BEST.
    </p>

     Vivek was quite happy when he cracked his first ever interview on campus.
     <span id="more-131140">
     </span>
     The thought of enjoying the college life in last year without the pain of campus interviews seemed quite pleasant.  He could crack this amazing company by being dedicated and disciplined in his interview preparation. As he recalls ‘I used to practice atleast 6 problems a day for two months before my interviews.‘ We at
     <a href="http://www.toptalent.in/" target="_blank">

     </a>
     spoke to Vivek  from Jadavpur University about his experience of giving an Amazon interview and what advise he had to offer for others looking to achieve something similar.

     </a>
     his resume to see how you can do it too.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      TopTalent: What companies did you get offer from apart from Amazon?
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     As Amazon was the first company in our campus, I didnt get a chance to sit for other companies. So its only Amazon interview that I can share with you.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      TopTalent: How do you feel on achieving this feat?
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     It feels great. No better feeling than hearing your name in the final bunch of shortlisted students. If one puts his effort with full dedication, it does pay off.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      TopTalent: Can you give us a brief account of what you felt was the toughest interview?
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     Since I have only gone through the Amazon interview process, so its Amazon by default. I can definitely share the toughest round I came across during my interviews. It was a question based on arrays. It was pretty tough. I was able to solve  this question and I think this question sealed my place in Amazon.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      TopTalent: What was your preparation strategy?
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     Not just going through the codes but finding the solution and implementing them on my own, no matter how long it took. That is the most important thing according to me that helped me crack this interview. Second thing was regular coding  to crack the online coding rounds. I used to practice atleast 6 problems a day for two months before my interviews. Third was the getting familiar with all data structures and algorithms.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      TopTalent: What resources did you consult? Where did you practice problems from?
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      TopTalent: What kind of skills do you think helped you getting this job?
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     CS fundamentals is very important . My 3rd round was completely on CS fundamentals. It lasted around for 1hr and 15 minutes. One should not ignore CS fundamentals when preparing for interviews . Data structures and algorithms is must as all know. Choosing one site and practice coding regularly is also very important.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      TopTalent: Whats your advice to students who are aiming for similar placement offers as yours?
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     2. For the coding part, once you have cracked a problem, always try to run the program at one go.
    </p><p>
     3. OS, DBMS and Networking. If you get a good hold on these subjects, it will make you stand apart from other candidates.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      TopTalent: What should one keep in mind while preparing a resume?
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     My resume had only one page in it. I would suggest to keep only relevant information in the resume. Most important thing, one should be ready to answer any query on everything in his or her resume.

     <strong>
      Online Round:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     There were two questions.
     <br/>
     1. N strings are given.Convert all string to corresponding decimal value typed in an Alphanumeric Keypad (e.g. "bdg" -&gt; 234). Then print all strings in decreasing order of their decimal value. If they have same decimal value then print lexicographically smaller first.
     <br/>
     Input:
    </p><p>
     2. Write a code to print all possible combinations(order matters) of characters of string in lexicographical order.
     <br/>
     Input: "ABC"
     <br/>
     Output: A, AB, ABC, AC, ACB, B, BA, BAC, BC, BCA, C, CA, CAB, CB, CBA
    </p><p>
     Interview:
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Round 1: 45 minutes
     </strong>
     <br/>
     This started with a brief discussion on project. She quickly moved on to Coding questions.
     <br/>
     She made me write an error free code for "Count all pairs which sum to k in a BST". Also she added that duplicates may be present but on left side only.
     <br/>
     First she discussed for approach and then constrained the space complexity to be O(1). She checked the code rigorously.
     <br/>
     Then there were 3-4 coding questions. She just discussed approach.
     <br/>
     -Update all nodes in a bst to be sum of all elements greater than or equal to it.
     <br/>
     – Stock problem/ Given an array ‘arr find maximum difference between two elements (max(arr[i]-arr[j]) where i&gt;=j).
     <br/>
     -Then there was this awesome question… Given a perfect binary tree.
     <br/>
     print nodes in a specific manner. e.g-
    </p><p>
     I told her approaches having some space complexity. Again she restricted space complexity, and I got an efficient solution by recognizing some pattern

     .
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 2: 25 minutes
     </strong>
     <br/>
     There were just two questions.
     <br/>
     1- Given a string having no spaces, and a dictionary.Problem was to find if that string can be splitted in multiple strings such that all the splitted
     <br/>
     strings are in dictionary. I was provided a function search(string str) which will tell if a particular string str is in the dictionary or not.
     <br/>
     I quickly gave a recursive approach.
     <br/>
     2- The second question was well known vertical order traversal of a binary tree.  She just discussed how to implement various approaches in C++.
     <br/>
     Then there was discussion on types of projects assigned to Interns and blah blah.

<h2>
        Amazon Interview | Set 118 (On-Campus for Internship)
       </h2><p>
     The selection procedure consisted of an online round followed by two Personal Interviews.
     <span id="more-130926">
     </span>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Online Round
     </strong>
     :
    </p><p>
     The first round had 20 MCQs and two coding questions. The MCQs were based on the concepts from OS, DSA, compilers, architecture etc.
    </p><p>
     The coding questions were:
    </p><p>
     1. Given an array of positive and negative numbers, arrange them in an alternate fashion such that every positive number is followed by negative and vice-versa maintaining the order of appearance.
    </p><p>
     2. Given a n x m matrix, print the elements diagonal wise from top to bottom.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      First round of PI
     </strong>
     :
    </p><p>
     1. Given a number n find the number of balanced parentheses expressions of that length.
    </p><p>
     Input: 2
    </p><p>
     Output: 1 which is (),
    </p><p>
     Input: 4
    </p><p>
     Output: 2 which are (()) and ()().
    </p><p>
     I gave a complex solution involving segment tree in which he pointed out the mistakes and then asked to write a code to check if a given expression is balanced or not.
    </p><p>
     2. Tell something about LRU. What DS will you use for it? Write pseudo code for it.
    </p><p>
     (Hint : Quite simple..Use doubly LL)
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Second round of PI:
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     The interviewer introduced himself first and then asked me about myself.
    </p><p>
     We had a discussion on my projects.
    </p><p>
     1. Given two binary trees, write pseudo code to determine if one is a subtree of the other. I answered it and then he modified the question to check if the other tree elements are the subset of the elements of the first tree. (Hint: Inorder traversal)
    </p><p>
     2. Given a sorted circular linked list which is rotated at some point, write pseudo code to insert a new node. Ex: 8 1 2 5 7 and insert 6.

        Amazon Interview | Set 113 (On-Campus for Internship)
       </h2><p>
     Amazon visited our campus to offer internship for 6 months. There were 3 rounds – an online coding round and 2 face to face interviews.
     <span id="more-130685">
     </span>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Online coding Round(Duration:1 hr 30 mins)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     This round was conducted on hackerrank.com. There were 20 mcqs related to computer science and aptitude.Many of these questions are there in the MCQ section of GeeksForGeeks. And there were 2 coding questions:
    </p><p>
     1.	Given a txt[0..n-1] and pat[0..m-1], write a function search(char txt[],char pat[]) that prints all occurences of pat[] and its anagrams in txt[].
    </p><p>
     2.	(Cluster Program) You are given a 2d matrix containing 0s and 1s. From a given position in matrix, you can move in all the 8 directions i.e. (i+-1,j),(i,j+-1),(i+-1,j+-1). You have to print the number of clusters of 1s in the matrix. Two 1s lie in a cluster if and only if we can move directly from one 1 to another.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Face to Face Interview-1(Duration:1 hr)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Interviewer started asking questions straight away without any introduction. He asked me the worst case complexities of Quick sort and Merge sort. Then asked me 2 questions related to trees:
     <br/>
     1.	Given an array that contains post-order traversal of a binary tree. Can you construct a single tree? I said no. Then he asked if i can make a binary search tree from the array to which i said yes. Then after discussing the approach, he asked to write the code.
    </p><p>
     2.	Then he asked me to write the code for level-order traversal of a tree. Also asked me to calculate the complexity of the code.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Face to Face Interview-2(Duration:about 1hr 30mins)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Interviewer started with the general introduction. Then he started asking questions.
     <br/>
     1.	Given n appointments with the start time, end time and a boolean variable hasConfilct, we have to set the boolean variable hasConflict of those appointments that conflict with the other appointments.
    </p><p>
     I have to set the the hasConflict of Appointment 1 and 2 as true.
     <br/>
     Initially, I did it in O(n^2). But then he asked me to optimize the solution. After some discussion, I was able to solve it in O(nlogn).
    </p><p>
     2.	Given that at Amazon.in the details page of an item shows only one field that is dynamically picked up from the database, we have to improve the performance according to the line:
     <br/>
     "80% of the users visit details page of 20% of products."
     <br/>
     I said we could store these 20% on the web server so that we dont have to fetch the item details from database everytime. He asked me where and how will i store it. I answered Main memory and will use BST to store it. Then after a lot of discussion(about 30 mins) on how will the get and put operations be used, he  was satisfied with the solution.
    </p><p>
     3.	Given a linked list placed in memory, what problems can arise if simultaneous operations are performed on the list. From here he started asking about threads because the answer was related to it.
    </p><p>
     4.	When a single threaded application is converted to multi-threaded applications, what kind of changes operating system has to make?
    </p><p>
     5.	What steps are taken when the os shifts from one-thread execution to another?
    </p><p>
     Finally, I was hired. Thanks to GeeksForGeeks for helping me throughout my interview preparation.

     <span id="more-130764">
     </span>
    </p><p>
     1.	Given an array, find the maximum sum that can be formed from the array such that no two  adjacent elements are taken into consideration..
     <br/>
     for ex:- 1,2,3,5 should return 7.
     <br/>
     2.	Print Vertical axis sum of the given binary tree.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 2:-
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Group Coding Round
     <br/>
     36 people made it to the next round. 2 questions were asked
     <br/>
     1.	Given an array which initially increases and then decreases, search for an element in the array.
     <br/>
     2.	Merge ‘k sorted arrays.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      <br/>
      Round 3:-
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Technical interview
     <br/>
     18 people were selected  for the next round and they asked me 2 questions
     <br/>
     1.	Given an infinitely growing sorted array which initially consists of 0s and then 1s upto infinity.  Find the transition point where 0 changes to 1 effectively.
     <br/>
     2.	Given a binary search tree, make 2 separate trees such that difference between the sum of elements between them is minimum.(After some time he gave me a hint which helped me solve the problem).
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 4:-
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Technical Interview
     <br/>
     1.	Some basic OS related questions
     <br/>
     2.	Implement a data structure which would perform insertion, deletion, search and randomize operation with minimum time complexity.
     <br/>
     We discussed a lot of data structures and I settled with a data structure (Hashtable with DLL). But he gave me clues and improvised my solution.
     <br/>
     3.	Implement  a Queue using 2 stacks. Optimise your implementation
    </p><p>
     (They didnt ask me to code in this round. They just checked how efficiently I approached it )
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 5:-
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Technical interview
     <br/>
     I think this is the bar raiser round. We are aware of the game show in which a contestant will think of a famous personality and the host will try to find the personality within a finite set of questions. I was asked to design a system which would implement the same. He asked me to write a code to return the first question (like the deciding factor on which the elements will be further partioned) so that I can find the celebritry in minimum no. of questions.
     <br/>
     I think they were checking your approach, ideas and patience in this round. Whatever solution I gave he never seemed to be satisfied. Be confident in your approach and dont ever give up.

<h2>
        Amazon Interview | Set 115 (On-Campus)
       </h2><p>
     Hai, recently amazon visited our campus for recruitment. Here is my amazon experience.
     <span id="more-130766">
     </span>
    </p><p>
     1000 people attend round 1
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Round 1: (1.30 hrs)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     20 MCQs + 2 coding question
     <br/>
     19 MCQs were from os,c++,java and single mcq from probability
     <br/>
     Coding questions:
     <br/>
     1. Find maximum sum in a array,such that no two elements are adjacent.
     <br/>
     For example 3,2,7,10 should return 13, sum of 3 and 10. Handle for negative cases too.
     <br/>
     2. Given a binary search tree,print the sum of all nodes that are in same axis (Modification of vertical order traversal)
    </p><p>
     I attended 12 mcqs. There was negative marking,so i attended the questions which i was very confident and did both programs.
     <br/>
     I was confident that i will clear the round 1.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 2: (Group Fly Activity) ( 1 hr)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Around 36 people were shortlisted for second round.
     <br/>
     We were divided into many groups and each group was alloted a mentor.
     <br/>
     Two questions were given and we have to discuss the approach with mentor and only after getting his approval we have to code.
     <br/>
     1. Given a monotonically increasing and then decreasing array with duplicates and a key, return true if key exists in array.
     <br/>
     2. Given k sorted arrays of different or equal sizes, merge them into a single sorted array.
     <br/>
     Thanks to mentor, he was very cool and helpful, I did both the codes and handled corner cases too.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 3: (30-45 min)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     18 people were shortlisted for third round and i was one among them.
     <br/>
     First the interviewer asked to tell about myself.
     <br/>
     Then he asked why i had low cgpa when compared with my school marks.
     <br/>
     Then came the first question
     <br/>
     1) Given n ropes of different length, combine them into a single rope,such that total cost is minimum. You can tie two ropes at a time,and cost of tying is sum of length of ropes.
    </p><p>
     First i gave a solution similar to insertion sort in a linked list,he was not satisfied, and then I gave a min heap approach. He asked for time complexity. I got wrong,so he asked what steps u will do and time complexity for each step. He added all the step cost and asked me to arrive at final time complexity.
     <br/>
     After this, I got correct.
    </p><p>
     Then he asked  about 2nd code in group fly activity.I used merge sort for it and he asked why i had used merge sort,and asked to improve the code.
     <br/>
     Then i gave a min heap solution (:P we discussed after group round). He asked me to code it. I was not good at heaps. I tried my best but unable to arrive at working code
     <br/>
     So finally he asked if i had any questions for him. I asked about amazons environment.After this i thanked and left.
     <br/>
     I was sure that i will be eliminated  and i was eliminated.
     <br/>
     Only 10 people went to 4th round and 3 people were hired finally.
     <br/>
     Here are some mistakes done by me
     <br/>
     It was first f2f for me and i was very nervous and had butterflies in stomach, which ultimately decreased my performance.
     <br/>
     I was not confident about the answer i gave.
     <br/>
     My communication skills  were very poor.
     <br/>
     So try  to avoid the mistakes done by me.

<h2>
        Amazon Interview | Set 117 (On-Campus for Internship)
       </h2><p>
     Recently Amazon India visited our campus for 2 months internship. There were four rounds.
     <span id="more-130773">
     </span>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      2 online coding questions + 20 MCQ :
     </strong>
     <br/>
     MCQs had 15 questions(not exactly) on OS (to my surprise) , one aptitude(probability) and rest on c/c++
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      2nd Round ( Group Interview / Written round) :
     </strong>
     <br/>
     21 were selected for the second round. We had 2 questions.
    </p><p>
     1. Given two strings, find whether they are anagrams of each other. (too easy).
     <br/>
     Its here..

      http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-whether-two-strings-are-anagram-of-each-other/
     </a>
    </p><p>
     2. Given a n-ary tree, Convert it into an array and return it. Construct the same n-ary tree from that array again. (DFS is better here as reconstruction is necessary) –
    </p><p>
     Push the root to a stack. "pop the stack.store the value of the root node and the number of children it has in the array.push all the children to a stack from right to left".. do this until the stack becomes empty.. the array will have dfs along with the number of children of each node.
    </p><p>
     For reconstruction,pass "i" by reference( i is for iterating through the array) take the value at index 0 .. make it has root. increment i. for all the children of the root, recursively call the same function. return root. (I hope this works :P)
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      3rd round (Face to Face):
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Only 5 were selected.I was asked only one question and i didnt do well. Find the square root of a number. i answered that this can be done using Babylonian method. (

     </a>
     ) or binary search method.. He asked me to implement Binary Search method. I did a mistake. then he asked me to correct it.. i corrected it. I wasnt able to impress him much.
    </p><p>
     Remember the floating point arithmetic limitations.. this is where i failed.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      4th round (Face to Face):
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I was called for 4th round. ( Only i had 4th round because of my bad performance in the 3rd round). The interviewer asked a lot of questions. They were easy
    </p><p>
     1.Given an array of 0s and 1s sorted. Find the first occurrence of 1 ( Binary Search)
    </p><p>
     2.Given an infinite array of 0s and 1s.(sorted) .Find the first occurence of 1(similar to this..

<h2>
        Amazon Interview | Set 119 (On-Campus for Internship)
       </h2><p>
     The selection procedure consisted of an online round followed by two Personal Interviews.
     <span id="more-130949">
     </span>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Online Round:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     The first round had 20 mcq consisting of 3-4 questions from aptitude, 2 questions from os and rest were from Basic C and Data Structure. There were 2 coding questions as well.
    </p><p>
     Question 1:  You are given a phone keypad like following diagram, where each character corresponds to a digit mentioned in the same box.
     <br/>
     <img class="alignnone" height="160" src="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/phoneKeyboard.png" width="120"/>
    </p><p>
     You are given n strings and you have to find their decimal representation. You have to print the string and corresponding decimal representation in descending order.
     <br/>
     Like if you are given "amazon" then its corresponding decimal notation will be 262966.
     <br/>
     If more than one strings have same decimal notation then you have to print them in the order in which input is given.
     <br/>
     (Given that given string consists of lower case alphabets only.)
    </p><p>
     Question 2:  Given a string. Print all Possible permutations of different lengths in sorted order.
    </p><p>
     Candidate who could solve at least one question out of 2 coding questions was selected for personal Interviews.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 2(P.I. 1) :-
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Firstly interviewer had a deep discussion of my project. He also asked me to write code for one of my mini project (Backtracking).
     <br/>
     Then he asked two back to back coding questions –
    </p><p>
     1.	You are given a bst. You have to print the kth smallest element.
     <br/>
     (
     <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-k-th-smallest-element-in-bst-order-statistics-in-bst/" target="_blank">
      http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-k-th-smallest-element-in-bst-order-statistics-in-bst/
     </a>
     ).
    </p><p>
     2.	You are given two sorted arrays and you have to print the median obtained after merging them in log(n) time complexity.
     <br/>
     (
     <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-k-th-smallest-element-in-bst-order-statistics-in-bst/" target="_blank">
      http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/
     </a>
     )
     <br/>
     Then he asked the language in which I am comfortable for coding. I said C . Then he asked me to allocate the dynamic memory of 2-d array in C( I used malloc function for this). Then he asked me the difference b/w malloc and new (c++) function.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 2 (P.I. 2):-
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Firstly he asked me to tell about my academic background. Then he directly put a coding question in front of me.
     <br/>
     1.	You are given a binary tree and two nodes. You have to print the horizontal distance between them.
    </p><p>
     Let us say :
     <br/>
     Given nodes are B and C : Answer would be 2.
     <br/>
     Given nodes are A and E : Answer would be 0.
     <br/>
     Given nodes are D and G : Answer would be 4.
    </p><p>
     We had an long discussion of 45 mins (approx.) on this problem.
    </p><p>
     One of my friend was asked the following questions:
     <br/>
     2.	Given a linked list. You have to determine whether or not it is a palindrome in order O(n) time without using auxiliary space.
     <br/>
     3.	You are given an array of integers . You have to find the maximum sum sequence.(It needs not be contiguous).
    </p><p>
     After all these rounds I and my friend both were selected
     <img alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" src="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif"/>
     :). A total of 16 candidates were selected.

<h2>
        Amazon Interview | Set 110 (On-Campus)
       </h2><p>
     Hi, Amazon visited our campus few days back.  Before I start off with my experience, here are few suggestions.
     <span id="more-130648">
     </span>
    </p><p>
     1. Dont just go through the codes. First try it on your own, thats very important. Once u have cracked a problem, write it in a paper and check for the corner cases.
    </p><p>
     2. For the online round.
     <a href="http://geeksquiz.com/" target="_blank">
      GeeksQuiz
     </a>
     is enough to get you through the MCQs. For the coding part, once u have cracked a problem, always try to run the program at one go.
    </p><p>
     3. OS, DBMS and Networking. If you get a good hold on these subjects, it will make you stand apart from other candidates.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      First day:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     20 MCQs(Data structure, C, C++, OS, Probability ).
     <br/>
     2 programs :
     <br/>
     1. Given an array of integers. Segregate all the non-zero numbers at the beginning. Print the number of non-zero integers and the minimum number of swaps required for these operations.
    </p><p>
     2. Given a text txt[0..n-1] and a pattern pat[0..m-1], write a function search(char pat[], char txt[]) that prints all occurrences of pat[] and its permutations (or anagrams) in txt[]. You may assume that n &gt; m.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Second day:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Suggestion: Always think loud when you are coding
     <br/>
     <em>
      <strong>
       Round 1 : PI   45 min
      </strong>
     </em>
     <br/>
     1. Discussion on Project.
     <br/>
     2. Code : LCA of a BST.(check for all corner cases)
     <br/>
     3. Code : LCA of a Binary Tree(check for corner cases)
     <br/>
     4. Code : Maximum sum subarry along with its starting and ending index.
     <br/>
     5. Code : Heap operations
    </p><p>
     <em>
      <strong>
       Round 2 : PI (With Manager) 1 hr 15 min
      </strong>
     </em>
     <br/>
     1. Discussion on project.
     <br/>
     2. Code : Given an array : A1[] = 2, 1, 2, 5, 7, 1, 9, 3, 6, 8, 8
     <br/>
     A2[] = 2, 1, 8, 3
     <br/>
     Sort A1 in such a way that the relative order among the elements will be same as those are in A2. If the element is not present in A2, append them at last in sorted order.
     <br/>
     o/p : 2, 2, 1, 1, 8, 8, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9
    </p><p>
     As I carried on telling him the approach, he went  on modifying the question ( what if A2 is much larger than A1 ?, what if they are of the same size ?)
    </p><p>
     A lot of discussion on complexities for all modifiactions. He was quite happy with my answers.
     <br/>
     Finally he asked me to code the O(nlogn) approach.
    </p><p>
     <em>
      <strong>
       Round 3 (Subject Round) 1 hr
      </strong>
     </em>
     <br/>
     1. OS : Virtual Memeory (lot of discussion of its advantages, thrashing , etc)
     <br/>
     Then he asked me design a LRU replacement policy(approach) which i did.           Then he asked to implement FIFO replacement policy with stacks. I did it using     two stacks.
    </p><p>
     2. Neworking : He started with Transport Layer( discussion on ports. How data        from applications are changed into packets ?, etc).
     <br/>
     Then he went to Network  Layer (A lot of discussion on subnet masking and how    it is used by routers to map the IP address of incoming packet, how a Subnet       is different from Internet).
     <br/>
     Next we moved to Data Link Layer( Discussion MAC addresses, sliding window    protocols, etc).
    </p><p>
     3. DBMS: What is indexing?, Why indexing ?, How to implement indexing ?,            What are the different types of Index? .
     <br/>
     Differences among Inner Join, Left Outer Join  and Right Outer Join. He followed     it up with a SQL query on Outer Join.
    </p><p>
     As my first three rounds went very well, fourth round was of 15 minutes only.
    </p><p>
     <em>
      <strong>
       Round 4 (Bar Raiser) 15 min.
      </strong>
     </em>
     <br/>
     1. Logical question. Given a prime number ‘p. Prove that p^2-1 is always divisible by 24.

        Amazon Interview | Set 109 (On-Campus)
       </h2><p>
     Amazon visited my Campus a few days back. I did not clear the final round of Amazon but I got selected in D.E. Shaw
     <span id="more-130641">
     </span>
     the very next day after rejection from Amazon
     <img alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" src="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif"/>
     <br/>
     Here is my interview experience of Amazon.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Online Round (conducted on HackerRank):
     </strong>
     <br/>
     20 MCQ questions and 2 Coding Questions (no C++ questions, C input-output questions(very hard) and aptitude questions).
     <br/>
     Coding Questions :
     <br/>
     1. Merge overlapping intervals(Very well known repeating problem).
     <br/>
     2. Given a singly linked list you have to subtract the value of first node from the last node and so on until you reach the middle node.
     <br/>
     Eg: Input: 5 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1
     <br/>
     Output: 4 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1
    </p><p>
     Advice: Many people say that making 1 code is enough to clear the 1st round while this is not true, I made both the codes and many of my friends who made only one code were rejected. Everyone who made both the codes were selected. There were some students who cleared this round by making only one code but dont try your luck here by making only one code is my suggestion.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 1(Bar Raiser):
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Complete discussion on my project.
     <br/>
     Suppose you have a file with billion entries and you have to sort the data of a file according to a column and can put only that column in memory and after putting that your memory gets full.
     <br/>
     e.g. your file contains
     <br/>
     name age address pincode sex
     <br/>
     …..     ….    …          …          …
     <br/>
     And you can have to sort the file according to pincode then you can only put pincode in the memory.
     <br/>
     I approached it firstly by using merge sort but this requires the entire file to be put into memory. Then, I suggested using min heap but he said that heapify process of billion numbers will take a lot of time. He said you are getting close, then I suggested that we can use a balanced binary search tree to store the pincodes along with indexes and then traverse the bst in inorder fashion and swap the indices of the first pincode of file with the index of inorder element. He was happy after hearing this and asked me to write the code and to be careful with edge cases.
     <br/>
     I did it.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 2 (CS Fundamentals)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     He wanted to check my knowledge of DBMS, OS, and Computer Networks. Asked everything related to these subject including all the layers of networks and from process-threads to deadlocks to memory management in OS. Asked a SQL query to find 3rd maximum marks of student from a database. I gave him 2 solutions
     <img alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" src="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif"/>
     .
     <br/>
     Asked me my favorite sorting algorithm. My favorite is insertion sort but I told him merge sort because I knew a lot about merge sort so I wanted to drive the interview towards merge sort and as expected he asked many questions on merge sort and I gave him all the answers.
     <br/>
     He asked me to build a tree from given preorder and postorder traversal of tree, I said it is impossible to build from only these 2 traversals , you have to give me inorder to build a unique tree.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 3 (CS Fundamentals + Coding)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Deep discussion about project.
     <br/>
     Asked me to choose my favorite subject other than any related to coding or algorithms. I said Computer Networks. He asked why it is your favorite ? Why not OS or DBMS?
     <br/>
     He asked me What happens when you type www.amazon.in in your browser. I was expecting this question
     <img alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" src="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif"/>
     . I knew this, told him everything.

     </a>
     <br/>
     He asked me to solve a coding problem now.
     <br/>
     Suppose I am given a sorted array of unknown size, then how will I search an element in this array efficiently.
     <br/>
     I said I can increase int i by the power of 2 and check whether the given arr[i] &gt; element to search whenever I find such element then I can apply binary search between i/2 and i. He said this approach will work but what happens if while increasing i , you cross the array length. Suppose an array is of size 6 , then your i will become 8 and arr[8] will give garbage value so your program may go in an infinite loop. I said I can increase i in try block and whenever this case occur then I can catch the exception in catch block where I will decrease i by 1.
     <br/>
     He smiled and asked me to write the code by taking care of edge cases.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 4 (Coding)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Deep discussion about the project which was on security. The interviewer asked me to design the database of a chat application similar to whatsapp. I did it and said what if some intruder access the database, then I said I will apply md5 encryption on phone numbers, then he asked me how md5 works. Why only md5? He asked me what are Man in the middle attacks and asked me to remove man in middle attacks from the message transfers. He was impressed.
     <img alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" src="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif"/>
     <br/>
     He then asked me what is cache, why are cache fast and how it differs from RAM and hard disk architecturally. This one was a bouncer, I hated computer architecture, admitted I am a beginner in computer architecture. He laughed and said thank god, there is one thing in which you are a beginner. I laughed too
     <img alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" src="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif"/>
    </p><p>
     He moved further towards coding.
     <br/>
     1. Suppose the structure of a binary tree is
    </p><p>
     Where random pointer points to any random node of the binary tree and can even point to NULL, then how will you clone this tree.
     <br/>
     This was the culprit question who led to my rejection.
     <br/>
     I gave a lot of thought to it, but wasnt able to solve it directly. I said we can use hash, then he said what if there are duplicates in the tree then your hash will fail, then I said we can convert the binary tree to doubly link list in place then clone the doubly link list, he said ok but how will you generate the original tree from doubly link list, I never said it was balanced. I gave a lot of thought here, nut yeah couldnt solve it.
     <br/>
     I got the solution by trying it after the interview, you can clone the left and right pointers easily by traversing the tree and to clone the random pointers, you can apply this : newroot-&gt;random=oldroot-&gt;random; oldroot-&gt;random=newroot;
     <br/>
     Then traverse new tree again and put newroot-&gt;random=newroot-&gt;random-&gt;random.
    </p><p>
     2.

      http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-row-with-maximum-number-1s/
     </a>
    </p><p>
     I solved it efficiently.

        Amazon Interview | Set 108 (On-Campus)
       </h2><p>
     Dear, I just got hired by Amazon in my campus placement drive. Below are the details of my selection process with amazon.
     <span id="more-130633">
     </span>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Fist Round(Online):
     </strong>
     <br/>
     20 MCQ questions and 2 Coding Questions .
     <br/>
     Coding Questions :
     <br/>
     1. Merge overlapping intervals(Very well known repeating problem).
     <br/>
     2. Given a singly linked list you have to subtract the value of first node from the last node and so on until you reach the   middle node.
     <br/>
     Eg: Input:   5 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1
     <br/>
     Output:  4 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      F2F-1:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1) Given a sorted circular link list and a pointer to random node, now insert a new node. I did it , but i used if and else for some special cases in my code so he asked me to do it without if else for special cases (generic &amp; simple code ).
    </p><p>
     2) Given a pointer to node in tree and a root pointer. Print all the nodes which are at a distance k from the given node.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      F2F-2:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1) He gave me task scheduling problem:
     <br/>
     Given a set of modules, some modules depend on previous modules and can only be executed, if the requirements of that module is complete.
    </p><p>
     so he asked me to give a schedule for above modules such that when a module is executed then all requirements of that module are complete.
     <br/>
     so answer would be D E C B A
    </p><p>
     2) Given a string of letters from alphabet. Remove all pairs(2 consecutive same character) of characters which occur consecutively.And do it recursively on remaining string.
    </p><p>
     Hint: He asked me to use some data structure for it .
    </p><p>
     3) Given a binary tree set the sibling pointers . I told him that i already know the question so he said code it .
    </p><p>
     4) He asked me about hashing .
     <br/>
     4.1 He asked me about complexity . I told him about O(logn) and O(1) .
     <br/>
     4.2 Then he asked me about how do you get O(1). I told him my approach . He said how will you rehash it when required . I told him that i will use extra memory and copy the hash map . Then i Optimized and did it in-place using a Boolean field.
     <br/>
     4.3 Then he took this question to OS and asked me to do it using threads .
     <br/>
     4.4 Asked me what all problems you will need to take care about this problem while using threads and give solution to it.
    </p><p>
     5) Discussion on my projects
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      F2F-3:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     He gave me 3 coding questions :
     <br/>
     1) Given a number n find the number of valid permutations of a string formed using characters ‘(‘ and ‘) . A string is valid if it has matching opening and closing parenthesis .
     <br/>
     Eg: given n=2 so you can have 2 possible  permutations which are valid (()) and ()() .
    </p><p>
     2) Given a singly link list reverse every 3 nodes and if nodes are less than 3 then reverse them also.
    </p><p>
     3) Given a string of letters from alphabet insert frequency of each character in the string.
    </p><p>
     Time Complexity Required O(n) Space Complexity Required O(1)
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Fourth Round (Bar Raiser):
     </strong>
     <br/>
     It was a telephonic round with a collabedit screen shared on our laptops.
    </p><p>
     1) Tell me something about yourself .
    </p><p>
     2) He saw that i had given a seminar on cloud computing and sky computing so he started with cloud computing .Then he asked me why didnt cloud computing exist 15 years ago .
    </p><p>
     3) What do you understand by 32 bit and 64 bit OS ? . He asked for explanations in terms of hardware and software . Then he asked me that will a 16 bit program run on 64 bit OS without any problem . He asked me what can be the reason for problem faced .
    </p><p>
     4) What happens when you type www.amazon.in in your browser ? . He asked me for the set of activities that take place during this time . Then he went into asking how do you get to know the IP address of your ISP . Then after a lot of discussion he was satisfied .
    </p><p>
     5) Some questions about Complexity of a algorithm . Asked me to prove complexity of few sample codes .
    </p><p>
     6) Some questions about storage space of a variable( data segment , stack , heap , BSS ). Some questions about Macro preprocessors and there problems &amp; solutions .
    </p><p>
     7) Some questions about error in sample code given (like returning non compatible pointer type or returning address of a local variable etc )
    </p><p>
     8) In DOS and Linux shell when we press the up arrow we get the recently used commands . He asked me to implement this facility. Then he asked me to do it if memory bound was very tight .
    </p><p>
     9) This was a question to check my analytic skills . We have customers using www.amazon.in for buying phones. Let say we have a user who visits www.amazon.in for buying mobile phone . He selects a mobile then fills his address details and then when he finally goes for payment then he gets to know that this phone is not available . So how can you improve the over all user experience . Then he asked me that will you suggest redirecting the user to some other site if the product is out of stock .
    </p><p>
     10) Some HR Questions like What are your areas of your Weaknesses ? What are you doing to improve on them ?
    </p><p>
     It was an amazing experience. Thanks a lot to GeeksforGeeks for helping me get my dream job
     <img alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" src="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif"/>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Suggestions/Tips :
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1) Discuss your approach as many times as possible.
     <br/>
     2) Dont start Coding the problem until the interviewer asks you to do it.
     <br/>
     3) Tell everything that you are thinking about the problem. They are more interested in knowing how you are approaching the problem.
     <br/>
     4) Asks for hints if you are stuck up. They will help you.
     <br/>
     5) If you dont know answer to a question then please say it directly. It will save time for other questions.
     <br/>
     6) First be confident about your approach then only code it.

<h2>
        Amazon Interview | Set 114 (On-Campus for Internship)
       </h2><p>
     Recently Amazon India visited our campus for 2 months internship. There were three rounds
     <span id="more-130745">
     </span>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      2 online coding questions + 20 MCQ
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     The MCQ questions were mainly 6-7 questions on data structures, 7-8 C language output programs, 4-5 questions on general aptitude, Probability, Permutation and Combinations.
    </p><p>
     The two questions were:
    </p><p>
     a. Given a set of intervals, you have to group the overlapping intervals and display all the intervals in non decreasing order.
     <br/>
     Eg: (1,5),(8,11),(3,6),(10,20)
     <br/>
     output: (1,6),(8,20)
     <br/>
     Tip: Although this is a very easy question and can be found on many online portals, just remember that the given input is in the form of a string and it needs to be parsed carefully.
     <br/>
     For this, instead of converting the string into integers, you could use something like
    </p><p>
     b. Given a set of integers, negative as well as non negative, You need to rearrange them such that negative and non negative integers at alternate positions.
     <br/>
     Constraints:   order of all the negative and nonnegative integers must be the same as before if there are more negative integers, the integers in excess should occur at the end of the array and same goes for the non negative integers in case they are more in number.
    </p><p>
     Again, for the input, you can use the above mentioned technique.
    </p><p>
     About 20 out of 150 students were selected after this round for Personal Interviews.
    </p><p>
     Following are the interview experiences of two of us.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Person1:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     <em>
      <strong>
       <br/>
       ROUND 1:
      </strong>
     </em>
    </p><p>
     1. Given a binary tree having 3 pointers, left, right and sibling out of which all the left and the right child pointers are already filled, you need to fill the sibling pointers with the addresses of the next node on the same level. If it is the last node of a level, fill NULL.
    </p><p>
     I first told him an approach using a level order traversal with a queue. Then he asked me to do it without a queue using recursion. I told him the approach and when he was satisfied, he asked me to write a code on paper with all the corner cases covered.
    </p><p>
     2. Given an array of size 2n+1 where n integers repeat two times and one integer occured only once, Find that integer. I told him by using XOR. then he changed the question to
     <br/>
     Given an array of size 2n+2 where n integers repeat 2 times and 2 integers come only once. Find both of them. This can also be done using XOR. You can find the solution in the arrays section of Geeks for Geeks
    </p><p>
     3. Given any binary tree in which all the leaves had their left and right pointers connected in a doubly linked list from left to right instead of pointing to NULL. Also, the leftmost leafs left pointer pointed to that node itself and the rightmost leafs right pointer pointed to that leaf itself and if there was an internal node with no left or right child, that particular pointer will point to that node itself.
     <br/>
     You need to find the Inorder Traversal of the tree.
     <br/>
     Once I told him the approach, he again asked me to write a code on paper.
    </p><p>
     4. He asked me about the data structures I knew and then started asking questions on Graphs. How we represent them?
     <br/>
     which is better Adjacency matrix or List?
     <br/>
     Then he gave some situations and asked me which of the two implementations should be used.
    </p><p>
     <em>
      <strong>
       ROUND 2:
      </strong>
     </em>
    </p><p>
     1. He asked me in detail about my projects for about 15 minutes.
    </p><p>
     2. Then he asked me about the subjects I had studied in 3rd and 4th semesters.
     <br/>
     I forgot what all subjects I had studied

     The first subject that came out of my mouth after a lot of thinking was Unix Linux Programming. Then he asked me to write all the commands I knew in 5 minutes. I listed almost 20. He asked me the functions of a few of them and differences between some of them.
    </p><p>
     3. Finally he asked me a question on binary trees which was pretty simple.
     <br/>
     Replace the data of every node of a Binary Search Tree with the sum of all the nodes greater than it.
     <br/>
     I gave him the approach using reverse inorder traversal. He then asked me to write a code on paper. I had used pointers in the code. He then asked me to write a code that did not use pointers, static variables or global variables.
     <br/>
     I wrote that. Finally he appeared satisfied.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Person 2
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     <em>
      <strong>
       ROUND 1:
      </strong>
     </em>
     <br/>
     1. Given a singly linked list and an integer k, I had to write code to reverse the list in pairs of k handling all base cases as well.
     <br/>
     eg. 1-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;4-&gt;5-&gt;6-&gt;7-&gt;8 k=3
     <br/>
     o/p 3-&gt;2-&gt;1-&gt;6-&gt;5-&gt;4-&gt;8-&gt;7
     <br/>
     She actually tried my code on a number of base cases trying to find bugs
     <img alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" src="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif"/>
    </p><p>
     2. Given 2 arrays one of size n and another of size (n+k) but having k values filled, I was asked to merge the two into the second array without using any extra space. I quickly gave her the logic and we moved on to the next question.
    </p><p>
     3. Given a string of characters, find the index of the first repeating character in the string.
     <br/>
     eg. abcba
     <br/>
     o/p: 0 (as ‘a came initially before ‘b did, though both are repeated twice).
     <br/>
     Again error free code was required.
    </p><p>
     4. She then asked me questions on the research project I was currently working on. This went on for another 10-15 minutes.
    </p><p>
     <em>
      <strong>
       ROUND 2:
      </strong>
     </em>
     <br/>
     1. This round started with questions on my research project. Then he asked me which data structures I liked. We had a long discussion on heaps and the associated time complexities.
    </p><p>
     2. Given a binary tree, any node in the tree and an integer k, print all the nodes at a distance k away from the given node.
     <br/>
     Mind you, the node may be above or below. We first discussed on an approach and after he was satisfied with my explanation, he asked for error-free code.
    </p><p>
     3. Given an integer n, how many BSTs can you make with n no of nodes?
     <br/>
     I told him about catalan number and the direct formula – 2^n – n. But he wanted a derivation, so I built-up a recurrence and showed him the DP to evaluate it.
    </p><p>
     4. Given n people, you are told all pairs of people who belong to the same country. You are to tell the number of pairs of people who do not belong to the same country,
     <br/>
     I expressed it as a graph and applied dfs to get number of connected components and size of each. Then it was a simple formula over no of components.
    </p><p>
     After this he started discussing the life at Amazon, what the company expects from you and what you should expect to do at the company.
    </p>

     <strong>
      First Round: Online:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     20 MCQs based on basic aptitude,OS,C programming and data structures.
     <br/>
     2 coding questions:
     <br/>
     1st: Consider a coordinate system consisting of n coordinates from (x1,y1)…..(xn,yn)
     <br/>
     Also there are two values ymin and ymax given to you. You have to return min(D) where D is x^2 + y^2 for all y lying between ymin and ymax inclusive. If there is no such y then return -1.
    </p><p>
     2nd: Given a number n and a number k. You have to find the next bigger number from n which is obtained after exaclty k swaps.
     <br/>
     Eg: Take n=43592169 and k=5
     <br/>
     1st swap: 43952169
     <br/>
     2nd swap: 49352169

     <br/>
     1. A linked list consists of two pointers: a next pointer and a child pointer. We have to make the linked list linear i.e. making all the child pointers NULL.
    </p><p>
     2. Given a distance n. A person standing at position 0 has to reach n. He can either take 1 step or 2 steps at a time. In how many ways he can reach there.
    </p><p>
     Finally some definitions from OOPS, OS and basic data structures.
    </p><p>
     I was finally hired for the Internship at Amazon. I would like to thanks Geeks for Geeks which helped me a lot in my preparation.

    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 1 (Online round 20 MCQs and 2 coding questions )
     </strong>
     <br/>
     MCQs were mostly on data structures ,time complexities and C,C++ outputs with 2 aptitude questions.
     <br/>
     1) Given 2 linked lists of digits as data in their nodes add two numbers.
    </p><p>
     2) given few sets of intervals print out the the entire intervals without overlapping , if they overlap then combine them into one.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 2 (F2F)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Tell me something about yourself.
     <br/>
     1) Convert a BST into inorder, preorder and postorder linkedlists inplace.
    </p><p>
     2) Make a queue out of 2 stacks, as it was easy he asked me to code and asked me the complexities.
    </p><p>
     3) Given a linked list with a loop find the loop and make it straight . I did with HashMap but he told me not to use extra space so i told him floyds cycle.
    </p><p>
     He asked me i had any questions.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 3(F2F) (After lunch)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1) Given a Binary tree convert into a BST no auxillary space (i did it with an inorder traversal) he asked me to code.
    </p><p>
     2) Given an infinite stream of characters find the first non repeating character at any instance , The storing,retrieval should be o(1) .
     <br/>
     I told him a solution using a hashmap then he modified that he may have millions of unique characters not just alphabets.
     <br/>
     i gave a solution with a linked list and a hashmap. This question was not asked to me but was to my friend .Its a good one.
    </p><p>
     3) print all the binary values of number from 1 to n , each numbers binary should be printed in 0(1).
     <br/>
     for eg:  n = 6
     <br/>
     then print  1 10 11 100 101 110.  printing 1, 10 ,11 ,100,101,110  should be in o(1) each
    </p><p>
     I thank Geeksforgeeks for letting me know about Floyds cycle .

     <br/>
     2) Can you reverse a list in less than O(n)?
     <br/>
     3) Differences between list and array. Which data structure you like and why?
     <br/>
     4) How will you find the kth node from last in a list? Discussion on optimization
     <br/>
     5) Given a string. Print all permutations of it. Discussion on time complexity and optimization.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round four:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1) Interleaving of a string. A big discussion on various test cases. Your code should handle the case if the string contains repeated characters.
     <br/>
     2) Check if a binary tree is a bst or not
     <br/>
     3) find diameter of a tree.Follow up how will find the height of a binary tree?
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round five: Problem Solving round
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1) Given an array of heights of poles. Find the no of poles which are visible if you are standing at the ith pole.
     <br/>
     2) You have a you tube video. A person watches the video in random order. You have given the start and end time of various intervals he watched. How will you confirm whether he has watched the full video or not.
     <br/>
     3) Given a number. How will you find the next greater number with same digits.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round Six: (HR round)

     where the modified array is {a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h}
     <br/>
     Input:
     <br/>
     1,2,3,4,5,6
     <br/>
     Output:
     <br/>
     1,3,2,5,4,6
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      3rd technical:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1. What do you know about memory management in Operating Systems? What is segmentation? What is paging?
    </p><p>
     2. Design problem: Given a station with n platforms.  So each platform has one line. But these n lines join into one, after leaving the platform (on both sides). Each train has to wait a minimum of x minutes in the platform. Trains arrive from both ends. If all the platforms are occupied they wait. There is also a point beyond the end of the platform (on both sides). This point indicates that an incoming train has to wait at that point until a leaving train (from that end) passes that point. Design the whole system.
    </p><p>
     3. How are big files stored in memory? What are the uses of B-tree? How is it more useful than BST?
    </p><p>
     4. Given one billion file indexes and said that n files are missing. How would you identify the file indexes of those who are missing?
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      <br/>
      4th technical:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1. Given an array of integers. This array denotes ‘our own ascending order of the elements. So if the array is {2,3,1,4}, by mathematics we can say that 2&lt;3&lt;1&lt;4. Given another array, sort this new array in ‘our ascending order.
     <br/>
     Lets say the new array is {1,2,4,3,5,4,9,2}, output will be {2,2,3,1,4,4,5,9}. Note that since 5 and 9 do not occur, they are sorted by actual ascending order at the end.
    </p><p>
     2. Integers are coming in a stream. A special integer (say -9999) denotes reset. Design a data structure such that when the special integer comes the previous elements are printed in a zigzag way and all the elements are deleted (reset). And then continues to accept other integers. What DS will you use?

     <strong>
      First day:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     <em>
      <strong>
       Round-1 :
      </strong>
     </em>
     <br/>
     20 MCQs(Data structure, C, C++, OS, Probability ).
     <br/>
     2 programs :
     <br/>
     1.	Given an array of integers. Segregate all the non-zero numbers at the beginning. Print the number of non-zero integers and the minimum number of swaps required for these operations.
    </p><p>
     2.	Given a text txt[0..n-1] and a pattern pat[0..m-1], write a function search(char pat[], char txt[]) that prints all occurrences of pat[] and its permutations (or anagrams) in txt[]. You may assume that n &gt; m.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Second day:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     <em>
      <strong>
       Round 2 : PI
      </strong>
     </em>
     <br/>
     1.	Discussion on Project.
     <br/>
     2.	Code : Given an array of integers. Find the minimum distance between two numbers.
     <br/>
     I did it in O(N) time complexity.
     <br/>
     Then he changed the question and asked what if the array is sorted and contains duplicates.
     <br/>
     I did it in O(logN) time complexity.
     <br/>
     3.	Given a linked list. Segregate all the positive numbers at the beginning and all the negative numbers at the end.
     <br/>
     I did it in O(N) time complexity.

     <em>
      <strong>
       Round 3 : PI

     1.	Discussion on project.
     <br/>
     2.	Code : LCA of BST.
     <br/>
     3.	Code : LCA of Binary tree.
     <br/>

     <em>
      <strong>
       Round 4 : PI
      </strong>
     </em>
     <br/>
     1.	Discussion on oops concept. Asked me about copy constructor, virtual function, virtual class,
     <br/>
     Template, exceptional handling.
     <br/>
     2.	Discussion on Os concepts. Semaphore, different page replacement algos.
     <br/>
     3.	LRU implementation using stack ( I was not allowed to use any other data structure).
     <br/>
     I did it using two stacks.
     <br/>
     4.	 It was a modification of this question.
     <br/>
     Our chef has recently opened a new restaurant with a unique style. The restaurant is divided into K compartments (numbered from 1 to K) and each compartment can be occupied by at most one customer. Each customer that visits the restaurant has a strongly preferred compartment p (1 ? p ? K), and if that compartment is already occupied, then the customer simply leaves. Now obviously, the chef wants to maximize the total number of customers that dine at his restaurant and so he allows (or disallows) certain customers so as to achieve this task. You are to help him with this. Given a list of N customers with their arrival time, departure time and the preferred compartment, you need to calculate the maximum number of customers that can dine at the restaurant.
    </p><p>
     Instead of restaurant and customers, I was given platforms and trains.
    </p><p>
     I was asked to design a data structure for that.

     2.	Discussion on different types of sorting techniques.
     <br/>
     Difference between merge sort and quick sort. When and where are they used.
     <br/>
     Discussion on counting sort.
     <br/>
     3.	Discussion on hash-map.
     <br/>
     Design a data structure which will provide the same function as hash-map.
     <br/>
     4.	Code : Given an array : A1[] = 2, 1, 2, 5, 7, 1, 9, 3, 6, 8, 8
     <br/>
     A2[] = 2, 1, 8, 3
     <br/>
     Sort A1 in such a way that the relative order among the elements will be same as those are in A2. If the element is not present in A2, append them at last in sorted order.
     <br/>
     o/p : 2, 2, 1, 1, 8, 8, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9
     <br/>
     I did it O(NlogN) time complexity.

     1.	Code : Convert little endian to big endian.
     <br/>
     2.	Code : Kth max in a file.
     <br/>
     I did it using min-heap, then he sked me to use other data structure.      Then I did it using Balanced binary search tree.
     <br/>
     3.	Code : Find the second non-repeating character in a string.
     <br/>
     4.	Given  prime number p&gt;=5 :
     <br/>
     Prove that : (p^2 – 1) will be divisible by 24.
     <br/>
     5.	Given a decimal number N as a string of digits (only 0s, 1s and 2s are there), how do I check if its divisible by 3 using regular expressions only, without converting to int? I was asked to design DFA for that.

     20 mcq question and 2 coding questions were there
    </p><p>
     Mcq consisted of questions from C, Data Structure, OS, and so on

     <b>
      <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
       Coding Question 1
      </span>
     </b>
     – Given a String and a pattern find all anagrams of the pattern in the original string. You need to print all the index of the location where the match was found
    </p><p>
     Ex –
    </p><p>
     INPUT –   ABDACDBACA
    </p><p>
     ABCD
    </p><p>
     OUTPUT – 1 3 4 5  (at index 1 BDAC , at index 3 ACDB and so on )
    </p><p>
     <b>
      <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
       Coding Question 2
      </span>
     </b>
     – Given an array containing zero and non zero digits you need to shift all the zeroes to the right of the array. Output should be number of non zero elements present in array and minimum number of swaps needed to do so.
    </p><p>
     Ex –
    </p><p>
     INPUT – 1 0 -6 5 0 0 2 0
    </p><p>
     OUTPUT – 4 (number of non zero elements)

    </p><p>
     Started with a general introduction with the interviewer. Some basic introductory questions like Tell me something about yourself and after we were settled he started asking question
    </p><p>
     1 . Given a binary tree store the vertical sum of the tree in a list.
    </p><p>
     2. Given a number you need to output the minimum number of factors needed to represent that number such that none of the factors is divisible by a perfect square.
    </p><p>
     EX-
    </p><p>
     INPUT – 8
    </p><p>
     So number of factors of 8 (2*2*2 , 4*2 , 8) (NOTE : do not consider 1 because it is divisible by all numbers) So minimum factor will be 1 (8) but it is divisible by 4 so not allowed then minimum is 2(4 * 2) but again 4 is divisible by 4 so not allowed so finally answer is 3 (2*2*2)
    </p><p>
     OUTPUT – 3
    </p><p>
     You need to explain the logic of both the programs and then have to code both of them

    </p><p>
     General Introduction about myself and asked me my Weakness and strongness and again once we were comfortable started asking questions
    </p><p>
      </p><p>
       () – onion of size 1
      </p><p>
       (()) – onion of size 2
      </p><p>
       ((())) – onion of size 3
      </p><p>
       So suppose if input is (()()) so output will be 2 because there are only two onions present in it
      </p><p>
       Again Complete coding of the two functions was needed
      </p><p>
       Then he started asking questions on subjects – OS , Networking and a SQL query

        Amazon Interview | Set 98 (On-Campus)
       </h2><p>
     I am a fourth year undergraduate CSE. I had my amazon interview in my campus.
     <span id="more-130432">
     </span>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      First Round:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     First round was a simple round. It had 20 MCQ questions on C/C++ and 2 coding questions. The coding questions were:
     <br/>
     1.) You are given a string that represent an expression of digits and operands. Eg. 1+2*3 , 1-2+4. You need to evaluate the string or the expression. NO BODMAS is followed. If the expression is of incorrect syntax return -1.
     <br/>
     Test cases :
     <br/>
     a) 1+2*3 will be evaluated to 9.
     <br/>
     b) 4-2+6*3 will be evaluated to 24.
     <br/>
     c) 1++2 will be evaluated to -1(INVALID).
     <br/>
     Also, in the string spaces can occur. For that case we need to ignore the spaces. Like :- 1*2 -1 is equals to 1.
    </p><p>
     2.) You are given an array of both negative and positive integers. You need to rearrange the array such that positive and negative numbers alternate. Also, the order should be same as previous array and only O(1) auxiliary space can be used and time complexity boundation O(n).
     <br/>
     eg. -2 3 4 5 -1 -6 7 9 1
     <br/>
     result – 3 -2 4 -1 5 -6 7 9 1.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Second Round:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     In this round, we were divided in groups of 5. And two problems were given and we need to write the code on paper for that problem.
     <br/>
     My code were :
     <br/>
     1.) You need to determine whether the linked list is palindrome or not.
    </p><p>
     2.) Print the level order traversal of the binary tree in the spiral form.[They also asked us the solution without any extra space and O(n)
     <br/>
     Time complexity].
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Third Round(F2F):
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Interview asked me to write the code for the two problems which are :
     <br/>
     1.) Reverse the alternate K Nodes of the Linked List.
     <br/>
     eg. 1-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;4-&gt;5-&gt;6-&gt;7-&gt;8-&gt;NULL
     <br/>
     Result – 3-&gt;2-&gt;1-&gt;6-&gt;5-&gt;4-&gt;8-&gt;7-&gt;NULL.
    </p><p>
     2.) You are given the binary Tree and the two nodes say k1 and k2 . You need to determine whether the two nodes are cousins of eachother or not.
     <br/>
     eg.      6
     <br/>
     /  \
     <br/>
     3    5
     <br/>
     / \  / \
     <br/>
     7   8 1  3
     <br/>
     and say two node be 7 &amp; 1. result will be TRUE.
     <br/>
     say two nodes are 3 &amp; 5. result will be FALSE.
     <br/>
     say two nodes are 7 &amp; 5. result will be FALSE.
    </p><p>
     3.) Give the algorithm, data structures, time complexity and space complexity for the following problem :
     <br/>
     In our mobile phones when we enter say four initials of the number say 9 4 5 6, then our phone shows the whole lists of number that starts with these entered number.
     <br/>
     Now the problem is : how it is implemented and what is the best way of doing this keeping the balance between space and time complexity. Also, user can enter any number of initials and your program should print all the numbers with those initials that are present in your phonebook.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Fourth Round(F2F):
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Interviewer asked some questions on C++ . They were :
     <br/>
     1. What are
     <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-functions-and-runtime-polymorphism-in-c-set-1-introduction/" target="_blank">
      virtual functions
     </a>
     ?
     <br/>
     2. What is the
     <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-functions-and-runtime-polymorphism-in-c-set-1-introduction/" target="_blank">
      use of virtual functions
     </a>
     ?
     <br/>
     3. What are pure Virtual functions?
     <br/>
     4. Syntaxes of Virtual functions and
     <a href="http://geeksquiz.com/pure-virtual-functions-and-abstract-classes/" target="_blank">
      pure virtual functions
     </a>
     ?
     <br/>
     5. What are
     <a href="http://geeksquiz.com/pure-virtual-functions-and-abstract-classes/" target="_blank">
      abstract classes in C++
     </a>
     ?
     <br/>
     6. How we can implement pure virtual functions in JAVA ?
    </p><p>
     Design question :
     <br/>
     How we can restrict our class so that only single instance of it can be created?
     <br/>
     What is Singleton Design Pattern?
    </p><p>
     Operating system Question :
     <br/>
     1. What are semaphores?
     <br/>
     2. What is producer consumer problem and give different solution for it?
    </p><p>
     Two questions he asked me to code :
     <br/>
     1.Convert one string to another string.For that purpose you can use three operations – SUBSTITUTE,DELETE,INSERT.Each having cost as one except
     <br/>
     substitute having cost 2.You have to determine the minimum cost required.
     <br/>
     For eg.
     <br/>
     First String : INCLINE
     <br/>
     Second String :DECLINE
     <br/>
     Minimum cost required are : 4 [change I to D and N to E].
    </p><p>
     2. Implement the stack in which push(),pop() and getMiddle() has O(1) complexity at any point of time.
    </p><p>
     3. Find the maximum size BST present in the binary tree.
    </p><p>
     He also asked question about my projects and why I choose them. He asked to just explain the whole set of thing that I have performed in it.
     <br/>
     (About 10 minutes discussion)
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Fifth Round(F2F):
     </strong>
     <br/>
     This round started with the deep discussion about my projects. Interviewer tried to get each and every aspect of my project with lot many why
     <br/>
     and how questions.She asked me the future scope of my project and what are learnings I got from it.(About 30 minutes discussion).
    </p><p>
     Then she asked me implementation, algorithm, data structures, time complexity and space complexity for the following problem:
     <br/>
     Say we have website having several web-pages. And also there are lot many user who are accessing the web-site.
     <br/>
     say user 1 has access pattern : x-&gt;y-&gt;z-&gt;a-&gt;b-&gt;c-&gt;d-&gt;e-&gt;f
     <br/>
     user 2 has access pattern : z-&gt;a-&gt;b-&gt;c-&gt;d
     <br/>
     user 3 has access pattern : y-&gt;z-&gt;a-&gt;b-&gt;c-&gt;d
     <br/>
     user 4 has access pattern : a-&gt;b-&gt;c-&gt;d
     <br/>
     and list goes on for lot many users which are finite and numbered.
     <br/>
     Now the question is we have to determine the top 3 most occurring k-Page-sequence.
     <br/>
     for the above example result will be : (k=3) a-&gt;b-&gt;c , b-&gt;c-&gt;d , z-&gt;a-&gt;b.
     <br/>
     [Question took the long discussion and she kept adding constraints, cases and more problems to the above problem.]
    </p><p>
     One question she asked me to code which is:
     <br/>
     You are given a sting. Find the character in that string which is not repeated and which occur last in the sequence.
     <br/>
     Eg.- aababaacdffgxc
     <br/>
     Result – x
    </p><p>
     I would like to thanks GeeksForGeeks which helped me to improve my knowledge and understanding of Data structures and Algorithms

     This is an account of my recent interview experience with Amazon. My process started off at one their hiring drives.
     <span id="more-129261">
     </span>
     It was a tiresome process that comprised a written round followed by six rounds of interview, spanning around 37 days.
    </p><p>
     Following is an account of my experience:
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 1 (Written round):
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1.      Given two linked lists each of which represent a number, write a function that returns a linked list that represents the sum.
    </p><p>
     2.      Given a sorted array of numbers. Construct a balanced binary tree with the numbers in the Array as keys.
    </p><p>
     3.      Given a sorted Array of numbers that has been rotated by a few positions, write a function to search an element in the Array.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 2 (F2F):
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1.      Given a binary tree in which the node structure has an additional field called "next" which of pointer to tree node type, fill up this field of each node to point to the next node at the same level (NULL if last node).
    </p><p>
     2.      Sort an almost sorted Array. An almost sorted Array being an Array in which a number is at the most k positions away from its position in the sorted Array.
    </p><p>
     3.      You are given a 2D grid in which each cell is either empty, contains an entry "D" which stands for Door, or an entry "W" which stands for wall (Obstacle). You can move in any of the four directions from each empty position in the grid. Of course you cannot move into a cell that has "W" in it. You need to fill each empty cell with a number that represents the distance of the closest door to that cell. (They asked me only for the Algo as there wasnt much time).
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 3 (F2F):
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1.      Given a 2D (Rectangular) grid of points. You need to find the shortest path from a given source point to a destination point. You can only move up or right. Now among these points, there a few special points from which you can directly jump to the diagonally opposite point (Top-Right diagonal). You are granted a function which when invoked on the point returns 1 if it is a special point and 0 if it is not.
    </p><p>
     2.      You are given a sequence of black and white horses, and a set of k stables numbered 1 to k. You have to accommodate the horses into the stables in such a way that the following conditions are satisfied:
    </p><p>
     a.      You fill the horses into the stables preserving the order of horses. For instance, you cannot put for horse 1 into stable 2 and horse 2 into stable 1. You have to preserve the ordering of horses.
    </p><p>
     b.      No stable should be empty and No horse should be left unaccommodated.
    </p><p>
     c.      Take the product (number of white horses * number of black horses) for each stable and take the sum of all these products. This value should be the minimum among all possible accommodation arrangements.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 4 (F2F with Hiring Manager):
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1.      Discussion on my current work, difficulties and challenges faced at work, difficult people I have had to work with, instances when I went out of my way to propose creative solutions to existing problems at work etc.
    </p><p>
     2.      Given a parentheses string, determine if it is a valid / legitimate parentheses string. For strings consisting of single parentheses type and those consisting of multiple types.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 5 (F2F – Bar Raiser):
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1.      Discussion on my current work, difficulties and challenges faced at work etc:-
    </p><p>
     2.      Given a floor of dimensions 2 x W and tiles of dimensions 2 x 1, write code to find the number of ways the floor can be tiled.
    </p><p>
     3.      Given a graph, if we were to print all nodes within k hops of a given node, which algorithm would we use, the answer to this was obviously a Breadth first search. He followed it up asking, if one were to use Depth first search instead to code this problem instead, one would encounter bloated running times for Graphs with certain attributes (Perhaps Dense graphs or some such). Describe what types of graphs would a DFS algorithm falter with and why.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 6 (Telephonic Interview):
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1.      Given that you want to maintain a backend for a bookstore Application that would store names of Authors and books, such that the application can return all the books written by a specific Author and all the Authors of a specific book which is specified in a query. The query can be such that only a substring of the Authorname or the bookname is specified and all the matches should be returned. I proposed a trie based solution, and was asked to code the solution on a collabedit shared document.
    </p><p>
     2.      Describe multithreading.
    </p><p>
     3.      Describe all the processes that happen between you typing in a URL and the webpage appearing on your screen.
    </p><p>
     4.      What is a singleton set What is the data storage model (Data structures) used to store records in a relational Database.
    </p><p>
     5.      Given an Array containing numbers between 1 to n, out of which 1 number is missing, find the missing number.
    </p><p>
     6.      Given a sorted Array and a number, print all pairs of numbers in the sorted Array that sum to the given number.
    </p><p>
     I got the confirmation call the same evening that I had the telephonic interview.

     2.       Given a linked list which contains representation of any number, like for 1234, the representation will be 1-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;4. Now we need to add 1 to the number, so that the output is 1-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;5
    </p><p>
     3.       Then he asked me 1-2 questions for which I immediately responded the solution, through that he got the idea that I already know the solution
    </p><p>
     4.       Moved to the white board, he draw a matrix, each contains only 0 ad 1 but in sorted manner. I need to return the row which is having the max no of zeros. Then he asked me optimized solution for finding the first ‘1 in the array
    </p><p>
     5.       Then he explained me a production line problem, Many factors were involved in that, robotic arm need to draw some lines with various colors on some wall. We need to minimize the cost of drawing those lines, Code was not required in that situation, as the problem set was very big, but we discussed the complexity plus solving procedure for each of the factors of the problem. Every minute detail of how will I solve the problem.
    </p><p>
     Basically problem itself was composed of many different types of sub problems, keeping mind open at that time is very important.

     Then after few days, I mailed the HR regarding the result, she told me one round is still pending, will update soon and after 1-2 week, they sent the mail for halting the process, didnt get any solid reason, as it was totally unexpected, all my rounds went well.

     </strong>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Round 1:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     •	Thorough discussion about one project that I considered as the most interesting or challenging.
     <br/>
     •	Suppose we need a service to perform certain task every day at some specified time. How do we ensure that everyday at the specified time the service will do that  task?
     <br/>
     •	Design a stack that supports push, pop, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.
     <br/>
     •	Program to get the maximum distance between two nodes in the binary tree. The interviewer further generalized this problem for n-ary tree. Then he asked how to get the longest path in a graph.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 2:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     •	What happens when we enter the url in the browser?
     <br/>
     •	Difference between inner join and outer join.
     <br/>
     •	How does the garbage collector works in java?
     <br/>
     •	Questions on stacks and heaps(memory management).
     <br/>
     •	We have n gold coins. We need to amalgamate all the n coins to create one single coin, we can merge two coins at once. The cost of merging two coins is equal to the value of those coins. How do we ensure that the cost of merging n coins in minimum.
     <br/>
     Ex: 5 ,8 , 4, 3, 9, 6
     <br/>
     We will merge 3 and 4, cost=7  {Remaining coins: 5,8,9, 6,7}
     <br/>
     Then we merge 5 and 6, cost=11  { Remaining coins: 11,8,9,7}
     <br/>
     Then we merge 7 and 8, cost=15   { Remaining coins: 11,15,9}
     <br/>
     Then we merge 9 and 11, cost=20   { Remaining coins: 20,15}
     <br/>
     Then we merge 20 and 15, cost=35   { Remaining coins: 35}
     <br/>
     Total cost: 7+11+15+20+35 = 88
    </p><p>
     If we had merged the coin array {5, 8, 4, 3, 9, 6} in different fashion:
     <br/>
     Merging 5 and 8, cost=13 {Remaining coins: 13, 4, 3, 9, 6}
     <br/>
     Merging 13 and 4, cost=17 {Remaining coins: 17, 3, 9, 6}
     <br/>
     Merging 17 and 3, cost=20 {Remaining coins: 20, 9, 6}
     <br/>
     Merging 20 and 9, cost=29 {Remaining coins: 29, 6}
     <br/>
     Merging 29 and 6, cost=35 {Remaining coins: 35}
     <br/>
     Total cost: 114
    </p><p>
     As we can see that the cost is less in the first case. Program to get the minimum cost of merging all the n coins.
    </p><p>
     •	Replace BST nodes with the sum of nodes greater than or equal to the node.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 3 (Hiring Manager):
     </strong>
     <br/>
     •	Detailed discussion of my work in the current company.
     <br/>
     •	Some behavioural questions like how do you handle certain situations etc.
     <br/>
     •	Design a restaurant reservation system. I was also asked to write some sql queries in this regard.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 4 (Bar Raiser):
     </strong>
     <br/>
     •	Given a linked list, write a function to reverse every k nodes (where k is an input to the function).
     <br/>
     •	Given a sorted array which may contain duplicates, write a method to find the starting  and the ending index of the given number if present.
     <br/>
     Suppose we are give array: 1,2,2,2,5,6,6,9,10,10,10
     <br/>
     If the number given is 9 then starting index and the ending index will be 7.
     <br/>
     If the number given is 2 then the starting index will be 1 and the ending index  will  be  3.
     <br/>
     If the number given is 7 the the starting and the ending index will be -1 as  the number is not present in the array.
     <br/>
     •	Write a method to compress a given string "aabbbccc" to "a2b3c3″ . It should be an inplace compression, no extra space to be used.
     <br/>
     •	Discussion about my current project.
     <br/>
     •	Describe a scenario when you failed, when you helped our collegue etc etc.

      2. First F2F round (DS and Algo)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Two interviewer was there in panel, Only one was asking question other was only observing, He was noting down all the conversation happening between us and noticing approach and solution provided by me. This was common in all the interview rounds.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      1)
     </strong>
     Given a infinite string of Os and 1s respectively. You need to find the transition point from 0 to 1.
     <br/>
     I gave the native solution in O(n). He told to optimize more. Direct binary search cant be applied on it because string was infinite and length of string was not given.
     <br/>
     I told that i will divide the string in 10 size slots it will reduce complexity. Still he told to optimize more. I told i will increase the slot size in power of 2 like 2,4,8,16,32. he was satisfied with that.
     <br/>
     He again complicate it by adding that now my string contain 0, 1, 2 in sorted order. You need to find transition point from 0 to 1 and 1 to 2. i provided the approach.
     <br/>
     After that told this time i want to make it generic. String can contain 0 to n(input) number find all the transition point. I solved it, he was satisfy with approach and told me write code for it.
    </p><p>

      1)
     </strong>
     It was bit difficult for me to crack, She stated asking from java cloning, which was my weak area. Given a class which contain string Name and reference to person friend, clearly shown below.
    </p><p>
     Suppose A–&gt;B–&gt;C–&gt;D means A is friend of B, who is friend of C and so on..
     <br/>
     Calling once the Clone method will clone the whole friend list like
     <br/>
     A–&gt;B–&gt;C–&gt;D (there A is the clone of A).
     <br/>
     Cracking this was really tough for me, because i was not familiar with these question.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      2)
     </strong>
     How to find the last nth element from singly link list, its was very easy for me.
     <br/>
     Solved in 2 min and wrote the code quickly.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      3)
     </strong>
     Given a sorted array of number , value K and value X, find the K nearest number to the value
     <br/>
     Example: Input 12 16 22 30 35 39 42 45 48 50 53 55 56 K = 4 X = 35
     <br/>
     Output 22 30 39 42
     <br/>
     Interviewer was running out of time because 1st question took huge time. So she told to tell only the approach, code was not expected.

      Message for all :-
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Amazon expect accurate and precise code with less complexity. So discuss first with your interviewer the approach. Dont jump into code.
     <br/>
     Even if you dont know the right answer, keep on discussing various possibilities to solve the question and try crack that problem with different angle. Practice more and more verity of questions.

<h2>
        Amazon Interview | Set 78
       </h2><p>
     The first round was an online test hosted on Interviewstreet.com. Around 350 students appeared in the online test.
     <span id="more-128168">
     </span>
     The duration was 90 minutes. It consisted of 20 MCQs based primarily on Predicting The Output, OS, CN and Data Structures.
    </p><p>
     These questions were pretty basic and easily solvable.
    </p><p>
     Apart from that, there were 2 coding questions.
    </p><p>
     1. Given a string, find the first element which is non -repetitive  i.e that element must not be present anywhere else in the string.
    </p><p>
     2.  Given a string of digits,find the next smallest number using the same digits.If its not possible to  get such a number print -1;
    </p><p>
     After a week, the results came out and 25 students were shortlisted.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Personal Interviews:
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Technical Interview 1 :
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     1. Given an array of 1s followed by 0s,find the number of 0s.
    </p><p>
     I solved it by using Binary Search to find the first and last occurrence of 0 in the array and subtracting the results.
    </p><p>
     2. Given an array of positive and negative numbers, find the pair of elements whose sum is closest to 0.
    </p><p>
     The brute force solution would be O(n^2) by comparing each pair of elements.As expected, he asked me to optimize my solution.
     <br/>
     So I sorted the array using merge sort. (I know its not in-place but it did not strike me at the time)
     <br/>
     Then used two indexes at the beginning and end of the the array and incremented/decremented the indexes as needed.
    </p><p>
     3. Given a Binary Tree , print all the root to leaf paths.
    </p><p>
     I started by telling him my approach and the logic behind the recursive solution that I had in mind. Then he asked me to write test cases for the function that I had written.
    </p><p>
     6 students were selected after this round.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Technical Interview 2
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     1. Given a binary tree convert it to a double linked list.
    </p><p>
     2. Given an array of integers , replace each element with the product of the remaining elements.
    </p><p>
     First, i gave the obvious solution. I  computed the product of the whole array and then divided it by each element to get the resultant array.
    </p><p>
     But he asked me to do it without using the division operation. After some cross questioning I gave the following solution.
     <br/>
     Store the product of the left side elements for each integer in an array L[].
    </p><p>
     Finally 2 people were selected.
     <br/>
     Result: Selected for a 6 month long internship as SDE-T (Testing)
    </p><p>
     GeeksForGeeks has been instrumental in my preparation for the interviews and I am really glad that I discovered this website at the right time.
    </p><p>
     PS : Could you guys tell me if the SDE-T position is inferior to the SDE-1 position or are they of the same level?

     1) Round 1 telephone interview – implement division without using division operator in log(n) time.
     <span id="more-126786">
     </span>
     <br/>
     solution: use bitwise shifting
    </p><p>
     2) Round 2 telephone interview – write a program to buy and sell stocks to maximize profit, can only do 1 action per day i.e. buy or sell.
     <br/>
     solution: I used 2 pointers to keep track of best buy and sell rates. I implemented it in O(n) time. He was happy with the solution.
    </p><p>
     After a few days I got a call from the recruiter saying the team was very happy with my interviews and wanted to meet with me in person.
    </p><p>
     I had to actually reschedule my on-site interview as I couldnt locate the office since it was not locatable on Google maps!!
    </p><p>
     I got in the office in Toronto. I was given a visitor pass and escorted to a meeting area where the interviews took place.
    </p><p>
     3) F2F(HR round)
     <br/>
     This was easy, the interviewer asked basic questions about my background and what made me choose computer science. I talked about my favorite project and she answered some my questions.
    </p><p>
     4) F2F(Director) he wanted me to do BFS search. Given a level, child index return the child node for a binary tree. I gave him a inorder search instead, he was okay with the solution.
    </p><p>
     5) F2F(SDE) this is when things started to get tough. He wanted me to design a library reservation system. He wanted me to explain him a design and draw some diagrams and then implement the classes.
     <br/>
     We didnt have enough time to do all of it. He wanted to know what data structure I would use to perform searches for books. I choose LinkedHashMap because it allows O(1) lookup and O(1) insertion.
    </p><p>
     6) F2F(SDE) He wanted me to build a boggle game. This is where I got a little mixed up with some java and C# syntax and he was not too impressed. I tried to write the algorithm using 2 for loops and he gave me some hints as to how to implement it.
    </p><p>
     7) F2F(SDE) Given a list of words, find anagrams. This was easy enough to implement. He asked runtime in the end.
    </p><p>
     The interviewers communicated with you all the time, its not like you go in an exam and quietly write what you have memorized. There is lots of pressure and lots of explaining to do as you write the code.
     <br/>
     All in all it was a great experience. The guys were cool and fun to interview with.
    </p><p>
     Geeksforgeeks was a tremendous help towards the interview.

          Hi,
         </p><p>
          Can you please explain solution and approach for Q. Design Parking system ? How to approach such design questions ?
         </p><p>
          For the overlapping rectangles problem what is the most efficient approach??
         </p><p>
            The best solution is ::
           </p><p>
            If the distance between centers of both rectangles is less than (half the diagnol of rect1+ half the diag of rect2) then overlapping.
           </p><p>
              What if the rectangles are not axis aligned??
              <br/>
              Then this approach wont work!!
             </p><p>
          regarding this "
         </p><p>
          Given coin array and a sum K, find min. number of required coin to make sum K. (DP Question)
         </p><p>
          "
         </p><p>
          should be greedy
         </p><p>
            No Author is right @xxmajia:disqus bcz Greedy could fail.
            <br/>
            you can take example.. suppose we got coin of { 2,3,5} and k=6
            <br/>
            is that possible by Greedy???… bcz greedy goes to 5 and will start searching rest 1 , thats not possible in that case.
           </p><p>
            DP only bcoz
            <br/>
            arr[] = (1,4,5); K = 8;
            <br/>
            Greedy gives 5 + 1 + 1 + 1 =&gt; 8;
            <br/>
            DP gives 4 + 4 =&gt; 2
           </p><p>
              thanks for correcting me
              <img alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" src="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif"/>
             </p><p>
          This doesnt seem like amazons interview… Questions were easy and everything is available online … Nice luck and congrats
          <img alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" src="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif"/>
         </p><p>
            I agree with you. But there is nothing called easy or tough. It depends on your preparation.
            <img alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" src="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif"/>
           </p><p>
              I have been at one of the best teams at amazon for over an year now.
              <br/>
              This would have been some low end team.
             </p><p>
                Never understood why they ask such questions in an interview. I see no point in seeing how much you have prepared.
                <br/>
                It is neither an indicator of your intelligence nor of your problem solving abilities.

          on campus or OFF CAMPUS??
         </p><p>
          why amazon always having one question related to mathematical in interview???
         </p><p>
          dont understand R4Q6, can you give an example?
         </p><p>
            for example for 24 it ll be 138
            <br/>
            for example for 36 it ll be 149

            for example for 100 it ll be 455
           </p><p>
            this is the solution:
           </p><p>
            suppose the given no is 100.
           </p><p>
            1. Find list of single digit divisors of 100. ie list = 1,2,4,5
           </p><p>
            2. take two indexes p and q which points to first and last in the above list.
           </p><p>
            3. find the third divisor of 100. (t = 100/(list[p]*list[q]))
           </p><p>
            4. if t is not single digit, increment p
           </p><p>
            5. if t is single digit, there are 3 cases
           </p><p>
            case 1. list[p] * list[q] * t = 100 =&gt; break(we found it)
           </p><p>
            case 2. list[p] * list[q] * t  ++p
           </p><p>
            case 3. list[p] * list[q] * t &gt; 100 =&gt; –q
           </p><p>
            repeat until all elements in the list are processed.

            generate lowest 3 digit number using a logic
           </p><p>
            Smart question i would say by the interviewer.
           </p><p>
          Regarding R3Q2, classic question
         </p><p>
          if (ff == 01) return 0;

            please explain?
           </p><p>
          round 3 1 O(1) space is converting to a DLL and checking for all possible pairs ? i see no other way can u tell the answer expected
         </p><p>
          how did you approach the problem of devicing a function f1 with new probablities?
         </p><p>
            Run the function f() two times. The possible outcomes are
           </p><p>
            00 with probability 0.4*0.4
           </p><p>
            11 with probability 0.6*0.6
           </p><p>
            01 with probability 0.4*0.6
           </p><p>
            10 with probability 0.6*0.4
           </p><p>
            Notice that the probabilities for 01 and 10 are the same. So create a new function f1() such that
           </p><p>
            f1():
            <br/>
            first = f()
            <br/>
            second = f()
            <br/>
            if (first == 0 and second == 0) or (first == 1 or second == 1): discard and run again
            <br/>
            else:
            <br/>
            if first == 0 and second == 1: return 0
            <br/>
            else: return 1
           </p><p>

<h2>
        Amazon Interview | Set 75 (For SDE-1)
       </h2><p>
     I  am currently in my 8th semester . I recently attended the off campus drive for SDE1 at Amazon. Heres my journey.
     <span id="more-127939">
     </span>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 1:- (Written)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     This was a written round . It was hosted on interview street.
     <br/>
     It was a 90 minutes test with 20 mcq and 2 codes
     <br/>
     1&gt; Return the longest palindromic substring in a string
     <br/>
     2&gt; Count the number of 2s in all number from 0 to n .
     <br/>
     Mcqs were based on ds algo,operating system and maths.
    </p><p>
     After two days I got a call from the hr that  I have cleared the written and a phonescreen is to be scheduled.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 2:- (Phone screen 1)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     This was supposed to be a 1 hour round. The interviewer shared a collabedit link.
    </p><p>
     1&gt; Divide an array into 2 subarrays such that the absolute difference of their sum is minimum. It was then extended to divide into two subsequences .
    </p><p>
     2&gt; Convert a sorted array to a balanced binary search tree.
    </p><p>
     3&gt; Convert a linkedlist with positive and negative integers into a list with first all negative integers, then positive. order amongst negative and positive numbers to be maintained .
    </p><p>
     Generally if first phonescreen is convincing the next step is direct face to face interview , else one has to go through another phonescreen . I had one phonescreen only . After a month i was called for inhouse interviews . All arrangements were made by them .
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 3 :- (Face to Face 1)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1&gt; Define a BST. Now check if a binary tree is a BST
     <br/>
     2&gt; Given an array of size n, and an integer k. find minimum number in every subarray of size k
     <br/>
     3&gt; Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining
     <br/>
     4&gt; Given an array find all triplets whose sum is equal to a given number k
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 4 :- (Face to Face 2)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1&gt; Find the diameter of a tree.
     <br/>
     2&gt; Print the diameter of a binary tree . (U have only left and right pointers)
     <br/>
     3&gt; Assembly scheduling problem (Dynamic Programming paradigm)
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 5 :- (Face to Face 3)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1&gt; How to check if two sets are disjoint ?
     <br/>
     2&gt; How to implement hashing for a set  .
     <br/>
     3&gt; Given n sets , give the minimal number of sets which must be removed so that the remaining sets are all disjoint (Variation of set packing problem)
     <br/>
     The interviewer was interested in some greedy heuristic as he knew its an np complete problem  and no solution can be better than exponential
     <br/>
     4&gt; You are given a matrix of 1s and 0s . The property is that
     <br/>
     every row of matrix is sorted in descending order . Return row with maximum number of 0s
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 6 :- (With senior manager)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Interview started with detailed discussion of projects.
     <br/>
     1&gt; Implement lastindexofastring(String s1,String s2) . If s2 is present multiple times return the last index of s2 in s1 , else return -1.
     <br/>
     2&gt; Given a paragraph of text, write a program to find the first shortest sub-segment that contains each of the given k words at least once. A segment is said to be shorter than other if it contains less number of words.
    </p><p>
     The interviewer then asked me if i had done something on multithreading . As i was not very confident so i said no and  he dint go further .
     <br/>
     He then asked me what is my biggest regret in my student life in college .
    </p><p>
     Amazon hrs were extremely helpful. After 3 days I got a confirmation call that I was hired. Geeksforgeeks has been instrumental in helping a lot of people to land  up in good companies. Keep up the good work

        Amazon Interview | Set 68 (For SDE-1)
       </h2><p>
     I went through the Amazon interview process for SDE-1, I didnt make it past the 3rd F2F round.
     <span id="more-126845">
     </span>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Online Round:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1. Find if a given string contains duplicates
     <br/>
     2. Given a BST, find the maximum N elements of the tree
     <br/>
     3. Given a BST, convert it into Doubly Linked List
     <br/>
     4. Rotate a 2-D Matrix by 90 degrees
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Telephonic Interview:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1. Given an array of integers (+ve and -ve), give a contiguous set of numbers that add to 1
     <br/>
     Eg.	4 3 5 -3 -1 2 -3 10 2
     <br/>
     Ans: 5 -3 -1 2 -3
    </p><p>
     2. Check if a given tree is a BST or not
    </p><p>
     3. In a 2-D Matrix with the following properties:
     <br/>
     i.  Contains only 1s and 0s
     <br/>
     ii. Every Row is sorted
     <br/>
     Find the row with maximum zeroes.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      F2F:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Round 1:
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     1. Print all the cycles in a directed graph
    </p><p>
     2. Given an unsorted array, assign every element to its immediate larger number after the current number, assign to -1 if no such number exists
     <br/>
     Eg. 3 1 2 5  9 4  8 should be converted to
     <br/>
     5 2 5 9 -1 8 -1
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 2:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1. In a 2 D array where every row and column are sorted, give the nth smallest element
    </p><p>
     2. In a Binary tree, every element must contain the sum of its sub-trees
     <br/>
     Follow up question: how would you solve this if you can ONLY increment the value of a node
     <br/>
     Eg. If a nodes value is 20 and its sub-tree sum is 10, the nodes value cant be set to 10 because you can only increment
    </p><p>
     3. Given n, find the smallest number for which product of the digits is n, if no such number exists, print -1
     <br/>
     Note: Digits can only be split as single digits, i.e., 132 cant considered as 1 * 32 or 13 * 2, it would only be 1 * 3 * 2
     <br/>
     Eg. Answer for 36 would be 49
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 3:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1. Convert a Binary tree into another binary tree whose in-order traversal gives a sorted list
     <br/>
     This has to be done in-place
    </p><p>
     Eg.

     Hi All, Here is my interview experience with Amazon for internship. Hope it helps:
     <span id="more-123687">
     </span>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 1:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Online round with 20 objective questions on (Questions related to data structures, analysis of algorithms, C Language and some puzzles.) and 2 coding questions in 90 minutes
    </p><p>
     Write a program to reverse k alternate nodes of a linked list
     <br/>
     Ex: 1-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;4-&gt;5-&gt;6-&gt;7-&gt;8-&gt;9
     <br/>
     If k is 3 Output should be: 3-&gt;2-&gt;1-&gt;6-&gt;5-&gt;4-&gt;9-&gt;8-&gt;7
    </p><p>
     Given a string. Write a program to form a string with first character of all words.
     <br/>
     Ex: The bucket is full of water
     <br/>
     Output: Tbifow
     <br/>
     Check all edge and corner cases.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 2: Face to face round
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Given a binary tree. Modify it in such a way that after modification you can have a preorder traversal of it using only right pointers. During modification you can use right as well as left pointers. Write complete code and dry run it for some test cases.
    </p><p>
     Given 2 linked lists. Find out if they intersect or not. If yes, find intersection point .Write complete code for it.
    </p><p>
     I could not remember the simple way: find the length of the lists and simply move forward the shorter list by difference of the lengths and find the intersection point. Instead, I joined the end of first list at the end of the 2nd list and then went for cycle finding by Floyd Cycle finding Algorithm. Although both are O (n), but he was impressed as it was a new approach.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 3: Face to face round
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Given a sorted array of 0s and 1s. Find out the no. of 0s in it. Write recursive, iterative versions of the code and check for all test cases.
    </p><p>
     Spiral level order traversal without using extra variable for detecting level (using one stack and one queue) and few other implementations as well.
    </p><p>

    </p><p>
          Round 2: the simple way of finding intersectn point. Can you explain the logic in more detail??hw the difference in the lengths of list works??
         </p><p>
          Given a binary tree. Modify it in such a way that after modification you can have a preorder traversal of it using only right pointers. During modification you can use right as well as left pointers. Can somebody tell me .. how to do this?
         </p><p>
            Just convert the Binary tree to a Doubly-Linked List such that printing the list prints the preorder traversal of the tree
           </p><p>
              If it is a binary search tree then we can convert it as singly linked list by inserting each node,left and right child in the same order and printing the list.
             </p><p>
              Push(LL, root)
             </p><p>
              For each node in the LL

<h2>
        Amazon Interview | Set 57 (Off-Campus for SDE-1)
       </h2><p>
     Hi geeks, I recently hired for amazon. I just want to share my Interview experience with You all.
     <span id="more-125596">
     </span>
    </p><p>
     Totally 1 Written + 5 F2F
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Written round:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Q1: Convert a sorted integer Array to balanced binary search tree. This is very simple one and I could do it in O(n) time and O(1)extra space.
    </p><p>
     Q2: Write a Program to reverse every k nodes of singly linked list without using extra space. Constraint: k&gt;=2
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      F2F round 1:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Q1: Find the largest element in the sorted rotated integer array in o(log n) time.
    </p><p>
     Q2: Find Height of a Binary Tree. This is very easy question, so I did quickly.then he move on to next one.
    </p><p>
     Q3: Find your own method to balance an unbalanced binary tree.(you must not use existing methods like AVL, red black or b trees).
     <br/>
     Hint: There is no restriction on placing nodes. You can remove any node from any place and put it in any place.
     <br/>
     I devised an algorithm which will make use of two lists. One list contains nodes far away from the root and this is sorted in decreasing order of levels and left to right if nodes are in same level. Other list contains nodes which are not fully filled. This is sorted increasing order of levels and left to right if nodes are in same level .
     <br/>
     Remove the first node (listed in list1) and insert as a child of first node in list2.add this node also in list 2. Do this operation until the height of the tree becomes log(n). Interviewer was impressed with this and finished the interview.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      F2F round 2:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Q1: There is a file which contains N words. There may be M anagrams in that file, K words on each anagrams. K&gt;=1, M&gt;=1, N&gt;=1. You need to write an algorithm which will create one list for each anagram with k words and group all M lists with one data structure (This is the main area.we need to think a data structure which will minimize the space and time complexity of word Finding appropriate List and Inserting word).
     <br/>
     I could do the insertion in O(1) time by keeping track of tail pointer in each list. But finding the appropriate list needs o(n) in case of linked list, o(log(n)) in case of binary search tree. Using hash table, you can do this in o(1), but writing a hash function is difficult and inefficient in terms of time. Then I suggested Trie data structure.with this, we can reduce the time complexity well. But space complexity will be more. I told all the ideas to interviewer. They were much satisfied with this. And moved to next question(without writing code J)
    </p><p>
     Q2: Find min and max element of an unsorted integer array.
     <br/>
     Very simple question you can do two pass on the array and find it, but number of comparisons will be o(2n). He asked me to reduce it.
     <br/>
     I gave an algorithm which will do the same in O((n/2)*3) which is fairly less than o(2n). They were impressed on my solution and asked weather I have any question .
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      F2F round 3: (CS fundamentals and system programming)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Questions were in C++ patterns, Network Programming, Linux, since I did project on networking, Linux I could perform well in this round.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      F2F round 4: (Hiring manager round):
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Interviewer was keen on testing cultural fit. Nearly 10 to 15 questions on my previous project,
     <br/>
     Why amazon?
     <br/>
     Why you want to leave previous company?
     <br/>
     What initiative you took in prevous company?
     <br/>
     How will you manage conflict with your manager?
     <br/>
     How will you demonstrate ur product to customer?
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      F2F round 5: (bar raiser)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     This also had cultural fit questions and then a data structure question.
     <br/>
     Qn: Find the distance between two nodes in a binary tree, no parent pointers are given. I could solve this in post order traversal in o(n) time complexity. He asked me to code in home and send it via mail.

<h2>
        Amazon Interview | Set 50 (On-campus for SDE)
       </h2><p>
     Recently, I have been through the interview experience of Amazon India and I would like to share my experience with everyone.
     <span id="more-123366">
     </span>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Number of interviews:
     </strong>
     1 online exam (will be completely evaluated by the compiler itself, then code of those who will clear the cut-off will be analysed by the hiring team) + 3 Face to face technical + 1 Telephonic (Technical again)
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Online exam:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     20 MCQ: Aptitude questions, if you are good in logical reasoning then dont worry about it (basic permutation and combination), C output questions, and most of them were pretty simple.
     <br/>
     2 Online coding questions: 1. Print the first non-repeated character in a string.
     <br/>
     2. Print the left view of a binary tree.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      1st Face to face:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     A skeleton of a binary tree with nodes having garbage values is given and an array is given. Had to fill up the binary tree skeleton with the values in array such that the resulting tree is a BST.
     <br/>
     Solution: sort the array, enter the values in an in-order fashion (A long discussion on which sorting algorithm is the best and why? We ended up discussing how merge sort can be optimized, just "optimized", not like reducing the order of time or space complexity). Then told me to write the merge-sort function for the discussed solution for merge-sort such that say I am a developer, I cant test on a machine, and this class will be used by a million number of users.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      2nd Face to face:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Was asked 4 questions: Print all string permutation (String might have repeated characters).
     <br/>
     Least distance between two values in a very big binary tree (Binary tree may contain same value in many nodes).
    </p><p>
     {Least distance is 3 between 1 and 2 (not 5).  }
    </p><p>
     Vertically print the value in a binary tree. Like in the previous example:
     <br/>
     4, 7
     <br/>
     1
     <br/>
     5, 3, 8
     <br/>
     7
     <br/>
     2
     <br/>
     Next, I was asked to design an efficient data structure for two lifts in a building of n floors.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 3 Face to face:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Had to find maximum profit in an array of stocks prices for consecutive days in two cases, one I can sell and buy any number of times I want, second, I can only buy and sell one time.
     <br/>
     Another question was to define a function "inorder_it(Node A, Node root)" which will return the next node in a binary tree to a particular node A. Was asked to write code for both of them.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 4: telephonic:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Kind of HR + Technical, asked a lot about my internship project and other academic projects. Then we discussed the problem of sorting rows of a file based on a particular column. Like as in Excel file, you can sort file based on roll_no, first name, last name, any column you want.
     <br/>
     File is very large, so you cant just store the whole file into memory.
     <br/>
     Solution: sort it out yourselves.
    </p><p>
     All the best everyone.
     <br/>
     And yes, I got through along with 5 other mates from my college.
    </p><p>
     <br/>
     Many many congratulations to the author. If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org. See your article appearing on the GeeksforGeeks main page and help other Geeks.

          Connect nodes vertically top to down in a binary tree
         </p><p>
          First using inorder traversal store the horizontal distance in a the node hd variable.
         </p><p>
          Used a HashMap with  as key value pair. it would store the first visited node of that
         </p><p>
          column/horizontal distance. So whenever we visit a node, first we check if its corresponding column/horizontal distance
         </p><p>
          is present in hashmap. if not , it means its the first node of column, put into map.
         </p><p>
          if the column present , then we will get the node stored in map (first node in particular column/horizontal distance).
         </p><p>
          we move till end of the list using nextVerticalSibling pointer and in end we set it as last node.
         </p><p>
          then include the left and right nodes in the queue
         </p><p>
          struct node
          <br/>
          {

          int hd;
          <br/>
          struct node *left,*right,*next ;
          <br/>
          }
         </p><p>
          void storeHorizontalDistance(SN* root, int hD, Hashmap hM)
          <br/>
          {
          <br/>
          if(!root) return;
          <br/>
          storeHorizontalDistance(root-&gt;left,hD-1,hM);
          <br/>
          root-&gt;hd=hd;
          <br/>
          storeHorizontalDistance(root-&gt;right,hD+1,hM);
          <br/>
          }
         </p><p>
          after storing hd do bfs and connect nodes verically. Hashamp will have  as key,value pair.
          <br/>
          1st node for each column will be stored in the hashmap
         </p><p>
          void connectNodesVertically(struct node * root)
          <br/>
          {

          hi again
         </p><p>
          test comment for my app
         </p><p>
          printing the non repeated character were asked with any complexity or as usual….because as usual it will be done by a single loop…
         </p><p>
          ques were good…what approach did you use for these ques–"Least distance between two values in a very big binary tree (Binary tree may contain same value in many nodes)."
         </p><p>
            find LCA of two nodes
            <br/>
            the path through the the LCA is the least distance path
           </p><p>
              ""Binary tree may contain same value in many nodes""
             </p><p>
              For this the LCA approach may go to n^2
             </p><p>
                Step 1) O(n) : Start searching for a 1 in the tree( DFS). For each node, store the distance of nearest 1 if  2 is present in it subtree, else store -1.
               </p><p>
                Step 2) O(n) : Do step 1 now with value= 2.
               </p><p>
                Step 3) Visit each node, at each node, find sum of dist_nearest(1) and dist_nearest(2). Find the min value of the sum at each node.
               </p><p>
                Ya u r correct..If it s a BST then above method will work
               </p><p>
            An approach

        Amazon Interview | Set 61 (For Internship)
       </h2><p>
     Hello geeks, Last month I appeared for the
     <b>
      Internship Interview of Amazon
     </b>
     .
     <span id="more-126030">
     </span>
     <br/>
     What my personal experience says is that never try to jump to the right solution straight-away, instead take your time and
     <b>
      think progressively
     </b>
     about the possible solution to the given problem.
     <br/>
     <b>
      Check for boundary test-cases
     </b>
     carefully and also dont remain completely blank during your conversation with interviewer but keep on telling him about the
     <b>
      tentative solutions
     </b>
     that are coming to your mind.
    </p><p>
     My entire process consists of
     <b>
      3 rounds:
     </b>
    </p><p>
     1. Online Round.
     <br/>
     2. 1st Telephonic Interview
     <br/>
     3. 2nd Telephonic Interview
    </p><p>
     <b>
      Round 1:
     </b>
     <br/>
     It was an online round consisting of 20 Multiple Choice Questions (from C language, Operating Systems, Data Structures and Algorithms and Software Development Concepts) and 2 Coding Questions:
    </p><p>
     1. Given 2 linked lists constructed another linked list containing the sum of those 2 linked lists. e.g Given :  1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3 and 4 -&gt; 5 -&gt; 6 Ans: 5 -&gt; 7 -&gt; 9
    </p><p>
     2. Find the Vertical sum of the given Binary Tree.
    </p><p>
     <b>
      Round 2 (Telephonic):
     </b>
     <br/>
     The duration of telephonic Conversation was about 60 minutes and the Interviewer asked me 2 coding questions:
    </p><p>
     1. Given an array of +ve as well as -ve numbers, find out whether it is possible or not to convert it to 0 by adding/subtracting operations on all the elements.
    </p><p>
     e.g arr[]={1,2,3}
     <br/>
     YES (1+2-3)
    </p><p>
     arr[]={3,6,2}
     <br/>
     3+6-2 != 0
     <br/>
     3-6-2 !=0
     <br/>
     -3-6-2 !=0
     <br/>
     -3-6+2 !=0
     <br/>
     -3+6-2 !=0
     <br/>
     -3+6+2 !=0
     <br/>
     3-6+2 !=0
     <br/>
     3+6+2 !=0
    </p><p>
     Hence ans= NO
    </p><p>
     2. Given a binary Tree where the structure of each node contains an extra "next" pointer (initially all NULL), modify the binary tree such that all the nodes at the same level gets connected by utilizing these given extra pointers.
    </p><p>
     The interviewer also asked me to write the code for the same.
    </p><p>
     <b>
      Round 2 (Telephonic):
     </b>
     <br/>
     The duration of telephonic Conversation was about 90 minutes and the Interviewer asked me 2 coding questions:
    </p><p>
     1. Write a code to find the
     <b>
      Diameter
     </b>
     of the given a binary tree
     <br/>
     Firstly I gave the solution which has complexity O(n^2) then he asked me to optimize it so finally I did it in O(n).
    </p><p>
     2. Given a number design the algorithm to find the next greater number which contains exactly same digits. e.g. n= 123 next greater with same digits = 132
     <br/>
     The number can be very large so its better to consider it as a sequence of characters.
    </p><p>
     I was also asked to write the code for the same.
    </p><p>
     I had a very great time preparing for the interview and got to learn a lot of new concepts.
     <br/>
     I am really very thankful to
     <b>
      GeeksForGeeks
     </b>
     for being the primary source of my preparation and believe me guys this website is just
     <b>
      awesome

          The problems are quite tricky…Are you a graduate student or undergraduate?
         </p><p>
          Well, I think that my solution for the question —
          <br/>
          Given an array of +ve as well as -ve numbers, find out whether it is
          <br/>
          possible or not to convert it to 0 by adding/subtracting operations on
          <br/>
          all the elements.
          <br/>
          works pretty well.
          <br/>
          Algorithm:
          <br/>
          1) Have a variable called result initialized to zero.
          <br/>
          2) Exor the absolute value of every input with the variable result
          <br/>
          3) Once all the inputs have been exored, the result must contain 0 if it is possible for us to convert it to 0 by adding/subtracting operations on
          <br/>
          all the elements.
          <br/>
          ELSE it has to be false..
         </p><p>
            arr={5,1,4,2}
            <br/>
            5+1-4-2=0
            <br/>
            101 ^ 001 = 100
            <br/>
            100 ^ 100 = 000
            <br/>
            000 ^ 010 = 010 != 0
           </p><p>
            Or what do you mean by "must contain 0″?
           </p><p>
          plz tell me how to apply for the  Internship at amazon
         </p><p>
          Round 2 Q1 : Input the array, find its sum, if the sum is odd, then we can safely conclude that no combination will exist. Find a subset having sum as (TotalArraySum/2). If such a subset exists then we can make all entries of this subset as ‘+ , and the remaining as ‘-‘, otherwise , no solution exists. Code for this approach:
          <a href="http://ideone.com/0LsvxX" rel="nofollow">
           http://ideone.com/0LsvxX
          </a>
         </p><p>
            complexity ?   o( n2 )  ?
           </p><p>
              Yes
             </p><p>
            the description of the solution you gave is correct, but the implementation is not: lines 22–25 are incorrect and the input to SubsetSum() should be sum/2, not sum.
           </p><p>
            recursive and dynamic programming solutions can be found here (complexity is O(sum*n) not O(n^2)):
           </p><p>
            <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming-subset-sum-problem/" rel="nofollow">
             http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming-subset-sum-problem/
            </a>
           </p><p>
              Let me explain my solution. There are 2 base cases, first one which takes of the condition when we have to reach a sum of 0. This can be done by choosing none of the elements, so it is always true (if we consider subsets of size 0,1,2…n. The second is when we have to make a given sum , without choosing any element. This will always be false except when the sum is zero. Please note further that input to SubsetSum is sum&gt;&gt;1, which is same as sum/2. Regarding time complexity , I dont think it is very much different , if the sum is of the same O(n). Technically though , I agree the code has an asymptotic complexity O(sum*n).
             </p><p>
                the implementation has been changed to reflect the errors i pointed out above. SubsetSum() is almost identical to the implementation linked above and the input is now correct.
               </p><p>
                there is no expectation that the sum is on the order of n and the difference can be pretty significant. also, the subset sum problem is NP-complete. if there is a polynomial time algorithm for solving it, that would be pretty shocking.
               </p><p>
                  Please note that no changes were made to the input or the calling of SubsetSum() function. Regarding NP complete, it should be noted that the problem though is NP complete , but the pseudo polynomial solution does work fine, unless the input (sum, or N) is very large. Any interviewer I think would be looking for this DP approach rather than a simple recursive brute force.If he is, then no doubt we should go with the brute force approach.
                 </p><p>
            this gonna work for non -ve integers only
           </p><p>
              Here is a changed code, in which we can store absolute value of each number, and then use the earlier approach :

               http://ideone.com/O1iz3L

             </p><p>
          thanks for sharing.
          <br/>
          regarding R2Q1, i can only think a brute force way to solve it. any better idea?
         </p><p>
            code
           </p><p>
            public static boolean isFeasible(int[] A, int p, int sum) {
           </p><p>
            if (p == A.length) {
           </p><p>
            if (sum == 0) {
           </p><p>
            return true;
           </p><p>
            } else {
           </p><p>
            return false;
           </p><p>
            }
           </p><p>
            }
           </p><p>
            return isFeasible(A, p+1, sum+A[p]) || isFeasible(A, p+1, sum-A[p]);
           </p><p>
            }
           </p><p>
            I think we can do it by dividing the array into two equal parts(i.e regarding sum of sub arrays).
           </p><p>
              ya, you are right, we can first get the sum of abs value, if its odd, return false.
             </p><p>
              dividing the array into 2 equal parts (regarding sum) – will this not be brute force?
             </p><h2>

     Interviewers were quite friendly. They would explain you till the point you fully dont understand. And even while discussing approach and solving, they would clear your doubts if any.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Online Test on InterviewStreet
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1. Given 2 string  , find whether 2nd is sub-string of 1st or not. (it would be great if you solve with KMP)
     <br/>
     2. Given 2 rectangles ,  find whether they are overlapping or not.
     <br/>
     3. Given list of coins with various values (unlimited coins of each type) , find how many ways you can make a given value. (DP was expected.) Since it was not guaranteed that coin of value 1 would be present , we have to return -1 if the given value is not possible.
    </p><p>
     All rounds on same day.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      1st f2f:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     First I was ask to introduce myself and give a brief over my projects. Latter he ask me to explain any one of my project and the hardest task I have done.
     <br/>
     We have used infix to post ix and postfix evaluation for our generic search expressions evaluation. Here we had a lot of discussion on why conversation from infix to post-fix was needed and all.
    </p><p>
     1. Given a String s and int r , first fill each character row wise and print column wise.
     <br/>
     for e.g. String s = "abcdefgh" and r = 3
     <br/>
     so filling column wise would give :
     <br/>
     a d g
     <br/>
     b e h
     <br/>
     c f
    </p><p>
     and final ans would be adgbehcf.
     <br/>
     he just wanted the exact output. Internally how we handle string was not concern.
    </p><p>
     2. given a string or say number .. for e.g. 134  now with each number , as per mobiles keypad , some letters would be associated.
     <br/>
     here 1 – &gt; abc , 3-&gt;ghi, 4 -&gt;jkl . So we should print all the permutation such that we take 1 character from each of the number.
     <br/>
     input number can be of any arbitrary length.
     <br/>
     lets say each digit has m numbers associated , then for the input of length n , we need to generate n^m possible strings.
    </p><p>
     Took a map of
     <integer,char[]>
      which would return all the letters for the number. solved it using recursion. its quite similar to permutation of string. .
      <br/>
      Interviewer seemed quite impressed here.
     </integer,char[]>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      2nd f2f
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1. Find integer part of sqrt of given number. Initially I gave o(root(n)) solution. Later solved with binary search(O(logn)).
    </p><p>
     2. Given an array of integers. replace each number with next higher number on its right side , which is nearer.(if not present than keep it as it is.)
     <br/>
     for e.g. input – &gt; 3 4 6 1
     <br/>
     output-&gt;4 6 6 1
    </p><p>
     I suggested we can traverse from right side , we will take extra array (o(n) space complexity here) and in that array , we would store index of next higher nearer number.
     <br/>
     so it would be like
    </p><p>
     Since we needed extra space to store indexes, he asked that the input is array of a structure which has number and higher Index, 2 fields. So that we dont need extra space and extra traversal.
    </p><p>
     He was very interested to see how i keep track of indexes and how i traverse between them. It is o(n) with o(1) space complexity. (when we have a[i]&gt;a[i+1] we dont do linear search , but we jump using the indexes, so its not o(n^2)) It was hard to convince him on complexity.
    </p><p>
     3. given a binary tree. connect all the node at the same level. each node would have left,right and nextSibling pointers. we need to fill nextSibling.
     <br/>
     solved with level order traversal . Similar to BFS on tree with queue. Only approach was needed, no code for this one.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      3rd f2f (Hiring Manager)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1. It was a design question.  You have to design a game. it has different types of monsters and different weapons. hero would shoot monster. each monster would have some initial health. Each weapon would do some predefined damage to monster. when its health gets 0, monster would die/disappear. and there would be multiple levels. based on level, monster and their behavior would change.
    </p><p>
     2. Given a read only linked list with next and random pointer , clone the list. I told him that i know the solution and explained him the approach. It was with the use of hashmap and takes o(N) extra space. Then he ask me whether I know a o(1) space solution, since I didnt knew, i was told to solve this. With this , he told that I can modify link list.
     <br/>
     Initially I struggled, but with his help, in the end came up with working code. He was looking fine with implementation.
    </p><p>
     Here I ask about the work culture and the process being followed at amazon.I ask lot of questions regarding tools and technology they use. Since I had work on scrum model , it was quite interesting. He seemed to be impressed here.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      4th f2f(Dev Manager)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1. Given 2 sorted linked list , merge them into single sorted list. Change the pointers, dont copy data. (same as merge part of mergesort on SLL)
    </p><p>
     2. Given binary tree, connect all the nodes which are in same column. 1 caveat was that same 1 node can have 2 parents. Here as in example, node 7 is being pointed by 2 and 6.
     <br/>
     Solved it using level order traversal. Used a Map
     <integer, node="">
      : columNo, Node. it would store the last visited node of that column. So whenever we visit a node, first we check if its corresponding column is present in hashmap. if not , it means its the first node of column, put into map. if the column present , then we will get the node stored in map and current node would be its nextVerticleSibling. and we update the map.
      <br/>
      He deed the dry run with example and code and he was OK with final approach.
     </integer,>
    </p><p>
     Finally after two days, I got call from HR that I am selected

          In the 2nd question of 2nd F2F round,we can use a STACK. We start traversing the list from the left and pop the node from the stack if the value of the node above it is greater than its value,and update the "higher" value of the node with the value of the node above it. We will continue this till we reach the end of the list. All the elements left in the stack will have their "higher" value updated to their current value.

          where were you working before amazon?
         </p><p>
          Hello Priyank congrats
         </p><p>
          Please clear 4th f2f(Dev Manager). This question is not clear. How you make binary tree. Is it given in the form of table or binary tree ? please make it more clear. Thanks I am waiting for your replay
         </p><p>
            same as sum of all vertical nodes/connect all vertical nodes.
           </p><p>
          Congratulations for the selection. Was this for Amazon hyderabad? Also, what is your total work experience?
         </p><p>
          In 2nd f2f Q2, its not O(N), its still O(N*N). Think about it again.
          <br/>
          Consider a sequence like 49, 48 ….1, 50,51,…100. In this the first
          <br/>
          N/2 elements need N/2 looks ups each.
         </p><p>
            when you are looking index for 49, you would have already solved the problem for 48 so it will have index to 50. so you can map 49s next index as 50 in two steps.
           </p><p>
          Im always confused when somebody says "working code". I mean in the F2F interview they asked us to write code on paper or system ?
          <br/>
          specially in amazons interview ?
         </p><p>
            In amazon – Paper or white board.
           </p><p>

          Many congratulations….please tell ur approach for
         </p><p>
          1. Find integer part of sqrt of given number. Initially I gave o(root(n)) solution. Later solved with binary search(O(logn)).

        Amazon Interview | Set 54 (For Internship)
       </h2><p>
     Hi All. Here is my interview experience for internship at Amazon.
     <br/>
     Position: 2-Month Intern
     <br/>
     No. of Rounds: 1 Online + 2 PI (2 F2F)
     <span id="more-123697">
     </span>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 1: (90 minutes)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     20 MCQs and 2 coding questions
     <br/>
     There were 20 MCQs based on C output, probability, basic maths, OOPS,  algorithm analysis and Operating Systems.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Question 1:
     </strong>
     Given a linked list, write a function to reverse every k nodes (where k is an input to the function).
     <br/>
     Example:
     <br/>
     Inputs:  1-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;4-&gt;5-&gt;6-&gt;7-&gt;8-&gt;NULL and k = 3
     <br/>
     Output:  3-&gt;2-&gt;1-&gt;6-&gt;5-&gt;4-&gt;8-&gt;7-&gt;NULL.
     <br/>
     Inputs:   1-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;4-&gt;5-&gt;6-&gt;7-&gt;8-&gt;NULL and k = 5
     <br/>
     Output:  5-&gt;4-&gt;3-&gt;2-&gt;1-&gt;8-&gt;7-&gt;6-&gt;NULL.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Question 2:
     </strong>
     Given a string containing words separated by arbitrary number of spaces. Write a function that returns a string consisting of the first letter of each word. (Note: there may be any number of spaces at the starting of the given string, at the end of the given string or in between words of the string.)
     <br/>
     Example:
     <br/>
     Input:  "   this  is   a  test case  "
     <br/>
     Output:  tiatc
     <br/>
     (Function prototypes and main was given for both the questions. Although many solutions passed the initial test cases, they were rejected later as they did not satisfy boundary cases.)
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 2: (face to face) (1 hour 20 min)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Question 1:
     </strong>
     Given two numbers represented by two linked lists, write a function that returns sum list. The sum list is linked list representation of addition of two input numbers.
     <br/>
     Example
    </p><p>
     I reversed the linked lists and simply added the corresponding nodes along with the carry. Then he asked me to solve the question without reversing the list. Then I solved the question iteratively without reversing the lists.
     <br/>
     The interviewer then asked me to write a recursive code for the same problem.
     <br/>
     After that he asked me to modify the code so that the carry at each place is passed by value instead of using pointers(which I had used in my code).
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Question 2:
     </strong>
     iterative and recursive code to reverse a linked list(Take Care of corner cases: when list has no nodes or contains a single node)
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Question 3:
     </strong>
     Write a function to check whether a binary tree is a sub-tree of another binary tree (Check for all corner cases).
     <br/>
     I solved it in O(n^2) time complexity. He did not ask me to optimize my code.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Question 4:
     </strong>
     Which data structure would you use to keep records of stock market?
    </p><p>
     I asked him to clarify the problem statement.
    </p><p>
     He then asked me : Suppose you have to maintain the stock values of various companies during various periods and return minimum stock value of a particular company over a given period of time.
    </p><p>
     I answered segment tree (Probably the correct answer was queue data structure).
     <br/>
     However the interviewer proceeded with questions on segment tree.
     <br/>
     He asked me to write a code for
     <br/>
     <strong>
      a)
     </strong>
     Creating a segment tree
     <br/>
     <strong>
      b)
     </strong>
     Performing range minimum query in a segment tree
     <br/>
     <strong>
      c)
     </strong>
     Updating the segment tree
     <br/>
     He asked me to analyze the time complexity for building the segment tree and performing the range minimum query in the segment tree.
     <br/>
     He then asked me: If you are to maintain the stock value of a company for the past 6 months..then you have to update the segment tree every day by deleting a stock value and inserting a new stock value. How would you do that?
     <br/>
     Here I got stuck and could not perform the updation in better than O(n) time.(However using queue it can be performed in O(1) time) .
    </p><p>
     He finally asked me if I had any questions.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 3: (face to face) (20 min)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Only one technical question was asked to me in this round.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      a)
     </strong>
     He asked me to speak something about myself and my technical achievements..
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      b)
     </strong>
     How to store a binary tree in a file &amp; then read back.(It is not necessarily a BST)
     <br/>
     First I answered that I would store level-order traversal of the tree.
     <br/>
     He then asked me how I would maintain the nodes at various levels (which I was unable to answer). So, I changed my approach and told that: I would store in-order and pre-order traversals of the tree from which the original tree can be easily retrieved.
     <br/>
     But then he told me to optimize my approach (As this approach would require twice the original space to store the data in the nodes). I could not further optimize my approach (However the better approach was to use parenthesization.
    </p><p>
     If this is the binary tree then it can be stored as   (A(B(D),(E)),(C)) in the file.)
     <br/>
     <strong>
      c)
     </strong>
     Then there was a 10 min discussion my project , the problems I encountered and how I solved them.
     <br/>
     <strong>
      d)
     </strong>
     Finally he asked me if I had any questions.
     <br/>
     I asked about the intern projects at Amazon and the use of DBMS and NETWORKING in it.
     <br/>
     He started elaborating the entire work-process at Amazon and his work-experience……..most of which I could hardly understand. He also told me to have a good knowledge of JAVA as it will be required at some stage during the projects.
    </p><p>
     Finally I got selected.

          F2F Q1: How to use pass by copy for maintaining that carry in Java, any idea anyone?
         </p><p>
            Never mind, solved it.
            <img alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" src="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif"/>
            <br/>
            Used a class variable to achieve it.
            <br/>
            Heres the code:

            </a>
           </p><p>
          Can somebody help me with F2F question1? How can queue be used to store stock values giving search in O(1) time? Wont the search be O(n)?
         </p><p>
            exactly I have the same doubt(after the interview was over some of my seniors suggested that the correct answer was queue)
           </p><p>
          The coding had to be done in C or any language?
         </p><p>
            any language you want to
           </p><p>
          For the round one question one, I was thinking of using two pointers and a stack.
          <br/>
          The second pointer is k nodes behind the first pointer and every k nodes the first pointer traverses they are stored in the stack. The second pointer while traversing the k nodes replaces their value by popping from the stack.
          <br/>
          Is this correct or were there some restrictions on using extra memory?
          <br/>
          And many congratulations!
         </p><p>
            Thats correct . There was no space constraint and this approach would get submitted successfully……..But it is always expected in such questions to change the links and not the value in the nodes.So it is always better to simply use a recursive or iterative algorithm to reverse every k nodes

          Can you please tell me how you did pass by value thing in link list sum question (face to face 1 question 1)
          <br/>
          1. Did you use pass by reference in C++???
          <br/>
          2. Did you use some kind of structure or class to return values?
         </p><p>
          Or some thing else???
         </p><p>
            Sorry,my bad. I should have used the term pass by copy(not pass by value).
           </p><p>
            Actually he asked me to pass by copy and not use pointers since the carry could either be 0 or 1.
           </p><p>
          congrates buddy:)
          <br/>
          can you plz tell me how could i apply for internship (i dont have any referral) ?
         </p><p>
            This was an on-campus selection process…amazon visited our college campus…I have no idea about off-campus application process

        Amazon Interview | Set 60 (For Internship)
       </h2><p>
     Believe me or not before I faced an Amazon interview round I was never sure whether all those gratitude that people usually present to GeeksforGeeks were actually worth.
     <span id="more-125960">
     </span>
     But it is always easier to connect the dots looking backwards and now I can say with assurance that this website really deserves all the applause.
    </p><p>
     I was recently interviewed for an internship position at Amazon and had to go through a total of 3 rounds i.e. one online followed by two telephonic rounds.
    </p><p>
     <b>
      <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
       Online Round
      </span>
     </b>
     <br/>
     As usual the online round had two coding questions and 20 MCQs. This was a pretty easy round and its duration was 90 minutes. The round consisted of questions from various domains like Algorithm, Data Structure, Operating System and Aptitude.
    </p><p>
     A few days after appearing in this round, I was informed that I have been qualified for the next round.
    </p><p>
     <b>
      <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
       First Telephonic Round
      </span>
     </b>
     <br/>
     I had just three days to prepare for this round and truly speaking, it was my first experience of appearing in any such interview.
    </p><p>
     This round lasted for almost 60 minutes. It began with my general introduction followed by a brief discussion on my projects. After this, the interviewer asked me four questions.
    </p><p>
     <b>
      <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
       Question 1:
      </span>
     </b>
     <br/>
     Given an array of numbers find all such triplets that satisfy the given condition.
    </p><p>
     <b>
      Condition:
     </b>
     a[i] &lt; a[j] &lt; a[k] where I &lt; j &lt; k.
    </p><p>
     At first go I thought that it was a pretty easy question but slowly the mist started to clear and I realized how tough it was. The interviewer wanted me to solve it in linear time i.e. O(N)
    </p><p>
     <b>
      <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
       Question 2:
      </span>
     </b>
     <br/>
     Given two trees check if they are mirror images of each other or not.
     <br/>
     This was a straight forward question and it took me less than 10 minutes to code it.
     <br/>
     Now the interviewer wanted to test my understanding of operating systems and asked two fairly direct questions, to which I gave my answer based on my understanding (not bookish definition as I did not remember any of those
     <img alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" src="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif"/>
     ).
    </p><p>
     <b>
      <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
       Question 3 &amp; 4:
      </span>
     </b>
     <br/>
     What is semaphore and what do you mean by a deadlock.
    </p><p>
     After two days I got a call from the HR informing me I have been selected for the next round. Now it was the time for the last and the decisive round.
    </p><p>
     <b>
      <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
       Second Telephonic Round
      </span>
     </b>
    </p><p>
     For this round I had slightly more time than the last, due to the fact that the weekend fell in between.The interviewer was very very cool and helping this time, something which I kept at the last in my list of probable things that can happen during an interview. Duration of this round was around 90 minutes.
    </p><p>
     This time I had to face three technical questions and one general question on Amazon.
    </p><p>
     <b>
      <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
       Question 1:
      </span>
     </b>
     <br/>
     Given a BST, replace each node with the sum of the values of all the nodes that are greater than that node. Only constraint being that I was not allowed to use any global or static variable.
     <br/>
     Although I panicked a bit and made few mistakes, I got through.
    </p><p>
     <b>
      <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
       Question 2:
      </span>
     </b>
     <br/>
     Given an array of numbers find the maximum count of duplets and triplets such that there sum is a multiple of three. Number that has appeared once cant be included anywhere else.
     <br/>
     I solved this question using a property of modulus.
    </p><p>
     <b>
      <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
       Question 3:
      </span>
     </b>
     <br/>
     Given the stock prices of 10 days find the best possible buy sell pair.
     <br/>
     For this question I started with a O(N
     <sup>
      2
     </sup>
     ) solution but then finally managed to reduce it to O(N) solution with constant space complexity.
    </p><p>
     I was also asked few questions on Amazon like what are domains in which Amazon deals.
    </p>


<h2>
        Amazon Interview | Set 58 (On-campus for Software Development Engineer)
       </h2><p>
     Im in E&amp;CE and Im sharing my interview experience with Amazon on IIT campus to help you prepare for your interviews.
     <span id="more-125642">
     </span>
     There was online test for 300 students. 25 were selected for interviews. There were 4 back-to-back rounds on the same day. My interview process lasted for around 5 hours and finally I got hired.
     <img alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" src="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif"/>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 1:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1. Given 1 billion integers. Find 100 maximum integers. Memory available is insufficient to store 1 billion integers.
    </p><p>
     2. Given array of N integers ranging from 0 to N-1. Output maximum repeating integer. Use only O(1) memory.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 2:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1. An array of integers is given such that it is first ascending and then descending. Find index of some given integer in that array. Ex. 2,4,6,8,7,5,4,3. Input: 4. Output: 2, 7. Write code on paper.
    </p><p>
     2. Two sorted arrays are given. Find median when both arrays are merged and sorted. Write pseudo code on paper. Take care of boundary conditions.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 3:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Basic OS, DB concepts.
    </p><p>
     1. You are given some integers. Propose a data structure to implement "add", "delete", "fetch" and "fetch any" operations. All four operations must complete in constant time.
    </p><p>
     2. There is a B-tree with two type of nodes A and B. Return nth A or nth B while doing inorder traversal in O(1) time. And write pseudo code on paper.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 4 with manager:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     There is very huge text file consisting several rows and columns of integers. Memory available is not sufficient to store whole text file. One column can be stored in memory. Sort whole file corresponding to given column keeping all rows unchanged. You cannot make new text file. Write neat code on paper.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Solution:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Round 1:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1. Make min heap of first 100 elements. For each remaining elements, if it is greater than root (min) node then remove root node, add that element then heapify. Time = 1 billion * log(100)
    </p><p>
     2. Simple. For i = 0 to N-1, A[A[i]%N] += N. Return i with max A[i]. O(n) time.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 2:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1. Find pivot point. O(log n) Binary search in both left and right arrays. O(log n)
    </p><p>
     2. Compare median of both arrays. Accordingly select right half or left half array. Repeat. O(log n)
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 3:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1. Make a hash table and a linked list. When you add an element add it in both hash table and linked list. But in hash table along value caralso store pointer to the same value in linked list. To delete an element find it in hash table, use stored pointer to delete the same element from linked list also. For fetch any operation return head node of linked list. Memory = 2*N
    </p><p>
     2. Preprocess in O(n) time: Make two vectors for A and B. Traverse in-order. When you get A add its pointer in vector of A. Same for B.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 4:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Read whole column. Heap sort (saves memory). Now you know old indices and new indices. Shift entire rows from old index to new index. Keep one row in temp storage to avoid overwriting.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Some tips that may help you:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1. Always be confident for whatever you are saying.
     <br/>
     2. Listen carefully. Ask doubts until the question is perfectly clear to you.
     <br/>
     3. Think out loud. Start with obvious approach and then improve upon it.
     <br/>
     4. They will test your way of approach, thinking process. Dont give up. Interviewer may give you hint if you are stuck.
     <br/>
     5. Direct them to ask you about your strong topics.

          For Round 4 Question 1, if saving memory was the main point, why would you prefer heapsort over quicksort ? heapsort requires additional memory while quicksort doesnt.
         </p><p>
            My bad…I forgot how heapsort works…sorry !
           </p><p>
          Round1-Q2 : Is not the solution O(N) space ?
         </p><p>
          for f2f 4 round use cycle sort after obtaining new indices in each column
         </p><p>
          Round 1 Q 2 : What if there is more than one most repeating number ? Like in the example : (4,4,3,3,1)
         </p><p>
          Agree with startupaddict1
         </p><p>
          For example,
         </p><p>
          [1 2 9 8 6 5 3], the peak is 2nd
         </p><p>
          [1 2 3 8 9 5 3]  the peak is 4th
         </p><p>
          How could you make sure that the peak is in left half or right ?
         </p><p>
            First find the Peak point(from where number starts decreasing), now from this point search(binary) both side… I guess so
            <img alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" src="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif"/>
           </p><p>
          For Round #2, question#2 how can you find the pivot in log(n)? For example consider the input like this:
          <br/>
          A = [ 1,2,3,4,5,   6,7,8,9,100,  99,98,97,96,95] . A[mid] = 8, then what?
         </p><p>
            Slight modification of bin-search,
            <br/>
            Take a[mid]
            <br/>
            if(a[mid-1] &lt; a[mid]
            <a>
             a[mid]&gt;a[mid+2]) {mid becomes new right}
             <br/>
             if(a[mid-1]
            </a>
            <a>
             a[mid+1]) {a[mid] is pivot and exit}
            </a>
           </p><p>
            <a>
             Pls. correct me if wrong.
            </a>
           </p><p>
          For Round 1 q2 solution, whats point of  A[i]%N? A[i] is in range 0 to N-1, so A[i]%N is always A[i]
         </p><p>
            Because it is done in-place, the elements of the array are increasing as traversing.
           </p><p>
              It cant be increasing, original array is N long and A[i] is never bigger than N
             </p><p>
                Not the length is increasing, check the statement again : A[A[i]%N] += N
               </p><p>
                  I see, the index of range problem, thanks
                 </p><p>
          &gt;&gt;Given array of N integers ranging from 0 to N-1. Output maximum repeating integer. Use only O(1) memory.
          <br/>
          For 2nd question in the first round cant we use Moores voting algorithm? This takes O(n) time and O(1) memory.
         </p><p>
            Moores algorithm also works.
           </p><p>
              Is it looking for the biggest number that is repeating (occurs at least twice) or is it looking for the number that repeats the most?
             </p><p>
              I think Moores law is used to find if a repeated element is present which is more than half the size of the array. In this case I guess Moores algorithm wont. Are you suggesting with any modifications? If so can you elaborate ?
             </p><p>
          Round q2 ,It seems  Your solution is not  O(1) Space ,its  O(n) space , and also the input is going to modify according to your method .
         </p><p>
          congrats!
         </p><p>
          Q4. After you sort the column, how would you get the old indices? How would you figure out how to pair the old index to the new one? How would you store them together with the new indices?
         </p><p>
            actually you dont need to know the "old index"
            <br/>
            lets say the original array is
            <br/>
            index: 0 1 2
            <br/>
            value: 3  2 1
            <br/>
            after sorting,
            <br/>
            index: 2 1 0
            <br/>
            value: 1 2 3
           </p><p>
            so use {2,1,0} as the "new index" to sort other column
           </p><p>
          Hi, could you give the code for the Round 4 question?
         </p><p>
          I have two questions regarding Round 3 question 1:
          <br/>
          Q1&gt; Can we implement it using hashtable ?
          <br/>
          Q2&gt;  Is this question same as: (
          <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9575905/how-to-design-a-data-structure-that-allows-one-to-search-insert-and-delete-an-i" rel="nofollow">
           http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9575905/how-to-design-a-data-structure-that-allows-one-to-search-insert-and-delete-an-i
          </a>
          )
         </p><p>
            In Round 3 Question 1: I dont think there is any need of maintaining a LinkedList because:
            <br/>
            Insert: HashTable can be used to insert integers as keys and values both. Time complexity: O(1)
           </p><p>
            Search/Fetch: In HashTable average case with good  hash function yields O(1) time complexity
           </p><p>
            Delete:Integer to be deleted can be used as key for searching .
            <br/>
            Time Complexity (Average): O(1)
           </p><p>
            PS: I am assuming fetch operation can fetch any operation and fetch operation are similar to search and returning operation in Hashtable.
           </p><p>
              "Fetch any" operation in hash table will take linearly more time with number of keys in has table. While in linked list you can return head node with O(1) time.

        Amazon Interview | Set 51 (On-campus for SDET)
       </h2><p>
     Hello Everyone!! Recently, I have been through the interview experience of Amazon India and I would like to share my experience with everyone.
     <span id="more-123374">
     </span>
    </p><p>
     Position : SDET
    </p><p>
     No. of Interviews : 1 Written + 4 PI (3 F2F and 1 telephonic)
    </p><p>
     Suggestions : Your code should be optimal, have proper variable naming, consider all corner cases and should not be lengthy.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 1: (90 minutes)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     20 MCQs and 2 coding questions
    </p><p>
     Coding questions :
     <br/>
     1. A string consists of parenthesis and letters. Write a program to validate all the parenthesis. Ignore the letters.
     <br/>
     eg. ((alf)ls) – valid
     <br/>
     )(dkk)() – invalid
    </p><p>
     2. You are involved in a betting game whose rules are as follows :
     <br/>
     a) if you win a round, the bet amount will be added to your sum and next bet amount will be $1;
     <br/>
     b) if you lose a round, the bet amount will be reduced from your total sum and next bet will be twice the previous.
     <br/>
     c) game ends when all the rounds are complete or you dont have sufficient sum.
     <br/>
     Initially, you are given with a string of the form "WLWWL" where W indicates a win and L indicates a loss and initial sum. Initial bet amount will be $1.
     <br/>
     You need to find the amount at the end of the game.
     <br/>
     Function prototypes and main was given for both questions
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 2: (face to face) (1 hour 15 min)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1. Given a 2d matrix in which rows are sorted in ascending order and columns are also sorted in ascending order .I need to find an element in optimal time complexity
    </p><p>
     2. In the same (M X N) matrix I have to print the matrix in increasing order of elements .write code for it(I used heap for that purpose and used concept of merging k sorted array).
    </p><p>
     3. Given an array , each element is one more or one less than its preceding element .find an element in it.(better than O(n) approach)
    </p><p>
     4. Given two strings STR1 and STR2 .we need to find longest substring in STR1 whose all characters are taken from string STR2(was asked to write code for it in optimal time)
    </p><p>
     5. Given a binary tree. I need to print the nodes in vertical line zigzag manner. For example: 1st vertical line from top to bottom, 2nd vertical line from bottom to top,3rd vertical line from top to bottom and so on
    </p><p>
     Answer would be –
     <br/>
     1
     <br/>
     2 3
     <br/>
     5 4 6
     <br/>
     9 7
     <br/>
     8
     <br/>
     10
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 3: (face to face )  (50-60 minutes)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I was asked about my project in details. He asked me project related questions for first 20 minutes.
     <br/>
     Next he asked to convert a binary tree in a doubly link list.
     <br/>
     I told him various approaches like by using space complexity and in-place conversion.
     <br/>
     I was asked to code all those approaches.
     <br/>
     Then he gave a hint about one more approach and asked to code it.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 4: (face to face) (60-70 minutes)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Again, I was asked about my project in details and he was questioning me on every part of it. Next he asked me to name the subjects that I have studied so far
     <img alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" src="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif"/>
     . He asked many theoretical questions on database management systems, SQL, operating systems, OOPs concepts and their real life examples and also two coding questions.
     <br/>
     1.  Code for  dfs of a tree(tree can be any general tree)
     <br/>
     2.  Print pascal triangle and your output should be same as pascal triangular form (have to consider the space separation) .I told him two approaches and wrote the code.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 5: (telephonic) (1 hour 30 min)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     For first 40 minutes he asked me about my achievements, about amazon company,  my project in details and what problems I faced in project and how I resolved them. next he asked one coding question.
     <br/>
     1. Find the square root of any number (square root can be a real number) without using any library function .
     <br/>
     I told him an approach using Newton-Raphson method. It was faster but he asked simple and optimal method so then i suggested binary search method ( O(log n)) and I was asked to code it and dictate and he ran the code on his system also.
    </p><p>
     Finally, I was hired with three of my friends.

            Use binary search. Suppose the number is n.So the sq.root lies betwen 1  and n.Now find x=(n/2)^2. If x&lt;n the sq.root lies between n/2 and n else between 1 and n/2.So after each iteration the length of the interval in which the sq.root lies is halved.Proceed similarly.

          Round 2 Question 3 ?
         </p><p>
            lets say we are at a no. k if this is equal to n(to find) then it is the answer otherwise jump to (n-k) position
            <br/>
            1 1 2 3 3 4 5
           </p><p>
            lets say we need to find  value 5
            <br/>
            initially we are at position 1 with value 1 …jump to 5-1 positions
            <br/>
            so current position is 5 and value is 3.
            <br/>
            jump to 5-3 position ..current position is 7 and value is 5 which is the required no
           </p><p>
              i think this is not correct… because array is not sorted . so we have to jump in both the directions

            question is to find peak element can be done using binary search
           </p><p>
              tnx for the reply…i think we should find any element ,not peak……

            The worst case is O(n) for your implementation for an array of form {key-2, key-1, key-2, key-1, key-2, …. key}, where key is the element you are searching int the array.
           </p><p>
              is there any other efficient  way ?
             </p><p>
            Solve for this input set :
            <br/>
            21,22,21,20,21,20,19,20,19,18
           </p><p>
            and the key is 18 .
           </p><p>
              yes, the code is working for your input array and key the output is 9 which is the index of 18 in the array…

            hint : if we assign root at x=0 then its left child is at x=-1 and right child is at x=1.
            <br/>
            similarly store the nodes at their respective coordinates using hashing and link list and print them accordingly

                hi xachit
               </p><p>
                Is this the bisection method??
                <br/>
                And is it really logn??and please explain the following
                <br/>
                val*val&lt;=n;
               </p><p>
                when val*val=n
                <br/>
                then we set low=mid;
                <br/>
                plz explain this point
                <br/>
                thnx a lot
               </p><p>
                  I the above method really log(n).i executed with 49.5224 as input and got answer in 26 iterations…..how can it be log n??number of more precisions ,number of more iterations??plz clarify
                 </p><p>
                  yes u are right ..complexity depends on the precision . for a perfect square it will be log(n)
                 </p><p>
            You have to use bisection search to find the nth root of a number.
           </p><p>
          is there any O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity solution for printing vertical lines ??

     1. Check if an undirected graph is a tree or not.
     <br/>
     2. Given an array of integers, print the 2 elements with least absolute difference.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Interview Rounds:-
     </strong>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Round 1:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Tell me about yourself.
     <br/>
     1. Given a matrix(not necessarily square) in which the elements in a row, as well in a column are sorted. Find a given integer in the matrix.
     <br/>
     Tell the approach. And then code.
     <br/>
     2. Given a position where a knight is placed on an nXn chessboard. Find the maximum number of knights that can be placed on the board, so that no 2 knights attack each other.
     <br/>
     Remember that you need to just give the number of knights, not all their positions. I first could arrange ceil(n*n/3) knights. Then he asked me find a better solution. Finally I got to ceil(n*n/2). Then he asked me to code it. Then he asked me to remove the ceil condition(check for even and odd separately).
     <br/>
     He asked me if I had some question for him. I asked – Amazon strives to be the most costumer centric company on earth. What, as a programmer/developer, do you do to achieve this, because generally, the customers problems are an issue for high level managers and planners.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 2:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Started with some questions from my Intern project.
     <br/>
     1. Given a Binary Tree, replace the data of each node by the sum of data of all its descendent nodes.(Leaf nodes will have 0)
     <br/>
     2. Given a sorted array of positive integers, find the least missing positive integer. First I gave an O(n) solution. Then he asked me to optimize it. Finally I gave an O(log n) solution.
     <br/>
     3. Given a stream of numbers, find k random numbers from them. I explained him Reservoir Sampling approach. He asked why this approach works. What is the probability of each number being selected? What is the probability of any number being selected if stream has less than k numbers(its 1).
     <br/>
     He asked me if I had some question. I said I had one, but I already asked it to previos interviewer. He asked me if I got a satisfactory answer to it. I said the answer was very much satisfactory.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 3 (CS Round):
     </strong>
     <br/>
     He asked me if I am comfortable with writing SQL queries. I prefered not to.
     <br/>
     1. What is an interface? Why it is used? Give an example. What is an abstract class? Why it is used? Give example. Why 2 different concepts of interface and abstract class?
     <br/>
     2. Do you know about singleton class? What is it? Implement a simple singleton class. I made some mistakes in making attributes static etc. He guided me and finally I corrected all bugs.
     <br/>
     3. Given a binary tree, where each node has an extra next pointer. Fill the next pointers so that each nodes next pointer points to its next sibling node. First I gave a solution where I would require a map, where each map key will be a level number, and value will be pointer to the last currently accessed node of that level. Then he asked me to do it without space. Finally I gave him a solution without space. I gave a non-recursive approach, and he asked me to code it.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 4(Senior SDE 3 from Seattle Office):
     </strong>
     <br/>
     He told me about himself, his team, his work and his teams work.
     <br/>
     1. Tell me about one of your challenging project/internship/class assignment.
     <br/>
     2. Give a situation from your life where you were given a negative feedback, and how did you tackle the situation.
     <br/>
     3. Explained me a cache situation, where,  keys will be in cache, and each key will point to a string. It was LRU cache condition, and I had to implement the LRU cache. Then write a function to retrieve a string, given its key, from this cache. Retrievel should be O(1) (if you give O(n) retrival, he will ask you to make it O(1) ).
    </p><p>
     Finally got an offer !!

    </p><p>
     While you are answering a question, clarify any doubts that come to you mind. Dont take any assumptions by yourself at all.
     <br/>
     Keep on speaking your approach as you think. Keep speaking, if possible, even when you write code. They want to test if you really know the approach, and not just copying code. All rounds were technical and elimination. The last round has the highest weightage in their procedure. Write clean code, ask for some time if you want.

          Round 1, Question 2.
          <br/>
          Can anyone please help me with the algo?
          <br/>
          I thought of an O(n*log n) approach, by sorting the array in O(n*log n), and then checking each 2 consecutive elements and hence calculating the difference in O(n) time (minimum will always be the difference between consecutive sorted elements).
          <br/>
          Is there a way to optimize this algo? Maybe O(n) time and O(n) space?

            say a = [1..100]; &amp; jump = 100;
            <br/>
            if a[100] != 100 then the missing number is in 0..100 range.
           </p><p>
            jump = jump/2; a[50] != 50 =&gt; missing number is in 0..50 range else its in 50..100 range, continue till u find the number
           </p><p>
              Its nowhere given that A=[1..100] , rather A can comprise of increasing sequence of integers starting from any element and it can even have more than one missing element.

              @disqus_0pyS83JuOW:disqus : What if numbrs in the are repeated..
             </p><p>
          Could u pls tell me the complexity of rnd1,ques1
         </p><p>
            Complexity is O(n)
           </p><p>
              In terms of rows nd cols ????
             </p><p>
                If ‘r is no. of rows and ‘c is no. of columns Then it is —
                <br/>
                O(r log c)
                <br/>
                r-&gt; for searching the row based on its first and last value
                <br/>
                log c-&gt;Binary search on sorted elements
                <br/>
                I would love to know If someone can propose something less than O(r) for searching the correct row.
                <img alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" src="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif"/>
               </p><p>
                  Apart from your strategy of finding the right row in O(r) and then BS in log(c) I have an another approach,though I am unsure if its Max(O(r),O(log c)).Here it is:
                 </p><p>
                  Start from A[0][0] and keep moving either right or down as per lesser value of difference between the number to be found and right or down value i.e
                  <br/>
                  Min( Val-A[i][j+1] , Val-A[i+1][j] ) should be able to lead you to the next element.
                  <br/>
                  Repeat till you find Val else return false.
                 </p><p>
          For LRU implementation , how did you reach o(1) complexity ?Did you give a Hash function? Or was he satisfied with the STL unordered_map ? Or sumthing else ?
         </p><p>
            doubly linked list would work i think…we can map keys to string and when we fetch the key we can get its corresponding key from the hash..wat say?
           </p><p>
              Yes, I kept a doubly linked list, and also a map.
              <br/>
              This map had had the key, and its value was the pointer to the corresponding node in the doubly linked list.
              <br/>
              Map retrieval will be O(1).
             </p><p>
          Round 2 Question 2
          <br/>
          Can you tell how did you optimize it to O(logn) for a general case ?
          <br/>
          Its off-course possible if array elements are unique,but not vice-versa .
         </p><p>
            It is similar to a binary search in sorted array:

              i got the approach of urs..can you plz give some mathematical observation for the same.
             </p><p>
          Round 2 Q1 : a recursive approach:

          </a>
          using O(log n) space if a height balanced tree, and O(n) time.
         </p><p>
            The solution you gave is incorrect. It says the sum should be only the sum of the descendants. So your function should be –
           </p><p>
            int DescSum(TreeNode *root)
            <br/>
            {

            if(!root)

          Round 2 Q2, is there an additional condition we have to assume that the numbers are only in the range[1,n] or , as otherwise the question is completely vague.
         </p><p>
          If the answer is yes , then I have an approach :
          <a href="http://ideone.com/KQsrLq" rel="nofollow">
           http://ideone.com/KQsrLq
          </a>
         </p><p>
            It fails for
            <br/>
            [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,13,15,17]
           </p><p>
              If you ran the code on this input as it is , it would fail , since the locations are indexed from 1 to n and not 0 to n-1 , The code gives correct output, if you add a leading 0 in the input :
              <a href="http://ideone.com/r02eR9" rel="nofollow">
               http://ideone.com/r02eR9
              </a>
             </p><p>
                It cant be done in logn time if duplicated exist in array .
                <br/>
                Your code returns 5 for {0,1,2,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,5}, which is wrong
                <img alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" src="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif"/>
               </p><p>
            There is no range given, and you can assume unique elements.

     <strong>
      Online Round (2 hours):
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Q1- Program to rotate a matrix by 90 degree clockwise.
    </p><p>
     Q2- Program to convert a binary search tree into doubly linked list.
    </p><p>
     Q3- Program to find a node which is just greater than a given node in a tree.
    </p><p>
     Q4 –Given a sentence. Find all the characters which are repeated more than 1 time and print them in lexicographical order.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      F2F interview 1(45 minutes):
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Q- Given a MXN matrix. To find the number of ways to reach the mth row and nth column cell from 0,0 cell. Find the same if some of the cells are marked as not reachable.
     <br/>
     First implemented using recursion then through dynamic programming.
    </p><p>
     Q- Given a linked list like a1-a2-a3-a4-b1-b2-b3-b4. Convert it into a1-b1-a2-b2-a3-b3-a4-b4.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      F2F Interview 2(50 minutes):
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Q- Given a sorted array of 0 and 1. Find the first occurrence of 1. Production working code was required. I provided him O(logn) solution. He asked me how it is O(logn). Then I explained him and generated the formula for same. He was convinced finally.
    </p><p>
     Q- Implement the cache using LRU technique.  Production working code was required.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      F2F Interview 3(1.5 hours):
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Discussion on my current project. He asked every minute details of my project and made me feel like he knows better than me about my project

     Then he asked me to implement a data structure for showing the currently visited items by a customer on any website. You will find the same on Amazon website at bottom left side.
     <br/>
     Program to sort m sorted arrays. I told him that I knew this. So we moved ahead.
     <br/>
     Data structure to push, pop and find min element in O(1) time.

     Q- To delete all the nodes from a binary tree that lie on a path whose sum from root to leaf is less than a given value K. Twist was that the node values can be any integer. It may be a negative number.
     <br/>
     He asked me to find the time complexity and space complexity.
     <br/>
     I did it using recursion with O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity. He said that there is some space being used by my program that I am not taking into consideration. I got his point. Since I was doing it using recursion, So some internal stack space was being used and that would be O(logn)i.e  height of tree. That was bit tricky.
    </p><p>
     Q- Given two sorted arrays. Find the median of the combined array.
     <br/>
     One thing that you need to keep in mind is that you need to provide them the optimized solution with respect to time and space and dont forget to consider the corner cases.
    </p><p>
     After 4 days I got a confirmation call from Amazon

          I forgot to mention one question. In the 3rd F2F round interviewer asked me to tell the approach for solving sudoku puzzle. I told him about backtracking but then he asked me to provide a more efficient solution. So i used a 3d array to store all possible values for a particular cell and then trace it to find out the one that fits there and doesnt violate the sudoku rules

          Hi .Praveen sir   Congrats..
          <br/>
          regarding online test.
          <br/>
          whether we need to entire code..or just functions…
          <br/>
          Should we  complete every question ?How they evaluate them..
          <br/>
          in f2f..complete working  codeis  required means..in the paper..or in the system…..
         </p><p>
            Hi sai
            <br/>
            for online test you need to write the entire working code, it may be a single function or multiple function it depends upon the question.
            <br/>
            Regarding the completion of every question i am not much sure but i have heard even if you dont do all the question there are chances that you may get selected provided you have done other questions well.
            <br/>
            There are some test cases that will run for your code and you can see the output of those testcases.
           </p><p>
            Complete working code means you need to write a code that will run properly for every corner cases. it should have null checks. you need to write your code in paper only.
           </p><p>
              Thank  You Sir
              <br/>
              i forgot to ask one question..did u face aptitude test..or directly went for online test…do they conduct written test for every selection process?
             </p><p>
                No there was no aptitude test. first round is always the written test
               </p><p>
                  thanks a lot for u r  reply sir..
                 </p><p>
          @geeksforgeeks:disqus  Why some of our comments getting removed…..Its Annoying!!!..can you guide me why so??
         </p><p>
          Hi praveen congrats,
          <br/>
          Can u plz tell me did they ask anything about ur current job and questions related to technology that u work on?
          <br/>
          thanks…
         </p><p>
            yes they ask about your current job. They want to know what actually you did so while going for interview be prepared with the points that you feel really describe your work at you current organisation. This discussion may go for 30 minutes too as was the case with me. They dont ask technology specific questions.

          Congrats man, I found relatively easy questions than other sets for me Well done.
          <br/>
          In F2F Interview 4 , 1st question…. worst case space complexity should be O(n) not O(logn) because tree of being balanced is not guaranteed… I think so
          <img alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" src="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif"/>
         </p><p>
            yes atiq you are right i told him that it should be o(n) in that case the tree will be a degenated tree(i.e a linked list type) but the interviewer asked me to find it out for a general case. Thats why o(logn)
           </p><p>
          Can anyone provide me the solution for F2F-1 Question -1 ("MxN Matrix ……")  in both recursive manner and using dynamic programming ??
         </p><p>
            Augment this solution

              Thank you !!! Also can you tell me how to solve for blocked indexes as well ?
             </p><p>
                Try Rate-Maze problem in Backtracking section you will understand.
               </p><p>
          Congrats !! Thanks for sharing.
          <br/>
          How did you apply offline ?
         </p><p>
            Thanks.. One of my friend referred me.

          congrats! thanks for sharing!
         </p><p>
          And for R2, (find the number of ways to reach m,n), you should be allowed to go only down or right. Otherwise there are an infinite number of ways.
         </p><p>
            how about unique paths….. it must give some finite value as we do in case of Rate-Maze augmented version(all possible moves is allowed)
           </p><p>
            Yes you are allowed to go only down or right..
           </p><p>
          what was the answer for F2F 3 question –  implement a data structure for showing the currently visited items by a customer on any website.
         </p><p>
            I guess….how about as simple as queue(by linked list).
           </p><p>
              The question was more deep than just a queue. It is to test your thinking that, for every case of login+logout, you will correct the queue properly. The second point is maintaining sync between your queue and the database. There are different ways to do this, so you just give out the ways and try to impress the most
              <img alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" src="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif"/>
             </p><p>
            this was the most difficult question i faced. Here we need to keep track of the customer and even if he comes later he should be able to see his items irrespective of whether he is registered or not. so we need to track the customer. So u will have to use ip address or some unique identifier for a customer and then u will have to create a list for his recently visited items which will point to the actual items stored in the database.
           </p><p>
              Just sharing a thought :-  ip addr. change everytime as normal users dont opt for static ip addr. but i guess u can store cookies. e.g. after visiting e-comm. site just checkout Elements (Chrome), u will see some string, expiry-date, max-age, domain etc. etc.
              <br/>
              so i guess it will be better handled compared to ip addr.
             </p><p>
          Q1, (rotating the matrix) – Were you supposed to do it in place?
         </p><p>
            in place is not an issue… very famous question.

        Amazon Interview | Set 49 (On-campus for SDE-1)
       </h2><p>
     Recently, I have been through the interview experience of Amazon India and I would like to share my experience with everyone.
     <span id="more-123362">
     </span>
    </p><p>
     Position: SDE- 1
    </p><p>
     No. of Interviews: 1 Written + 4 PI (3 F2F and 1 telephonic)
    </p><p>
     Before telling you the questions and interview procedure, I would like to offer some suggestions. There are always instances when your interview is not off with a great start. You need not panic and keep your calm. Secondly, to compensate all the shortcomings in the technical part, interact with the interviewer as much as you can. Show him that you are really interested in the company. They are looking for future managers not just coders, so you have to have people skills.
    </p><p>
     Okay, so here we go:
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Day 1:
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 1 : (Written on Interview Street)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     20 MCQ questions consisting of Data Structure, Algorithms, Operating Systems, Probability, Combinatorics and Quatitative Analysis.
    </p><p>
     Suggestion: Always code your solution on the editor provided on the website. It takes screenshots of the page so if you copy a large chunk of data even from your notepad thats considered as cheating.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Coding Problems :
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1. A string consists of parentheses and letters. Write a program to validate all the parentheses. Ignore the letters.
     <br/>
     eg. ((alf)ls) – valid
     <br/>
     )(dkk)() – invalid
    </p><p>
     2. You are involved in a betting game whose rules are as follows :
     <br/>
     a) if you win a round, the bet amount will be added to your sum and next bet amount will be $1;
     <br/>
     b) if you lose a round, the bet amount will be reduced from your total sum and next bet will be twice the previous.
     <br/>
     c) game ends when all the rounds are complete or you dont have sufficient sum.
     <br/>
     Initially, you are given with a string of the form "WLWWL" where W indicates a win and L indicates a loss and initial sum. Initial bet amount will be $1.
    </p><p>
     Function prototypes and main was given for both questions.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 2 : (Face to Face)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     The interview started off with a light discussion about myself, achievements. Then he asked me about my project and the difficulties faced. Then we moved on to coding problems.
    </p><p>
     Q1: You are given an array in which youve to find a contiguous subarray such that the sum of elements in it is equal to zero. (I coded using hashtable in java)
     <br/>
     Q2: Given a binary tree. Find out if it is a binary search tree or not.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 3: (Face to Face)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Q1: You are given a generic tree. Design a structure for it. Now for every node of the tree make the leftmost child of the node as a duplicate of the node itself and return the root of the tree.
     <br/>
     Q2: He: Tell me the time complexity of 8-queen problem.
     <br/>
     Me: (I did not exactly remember the complexity so I coded)
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 4: (Face to Face)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     He asked me variety of theory questions, I was stumped as I did not know many things. He asked me about ACID properties, oops concepts, SQL etc. out of which I could answer only a few.
     <br/>
     Then we switched over to coding.
     <br/>
     Q1: He: You are given various time intervals and you have to merge the overlapping ones.
     <br/>
     Me: I had already coded it in the Code Ninja questions on the amazons website, so he just asked me the approach to the question.
     <br/>
     Q2: You are given a binary tree. Tell me if it is height balanced or not.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 5: (Telephonic)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     The interview started with if I had any questions, and then proceeded with the projects Ive done.
     <br/>
     Q1: You are given a file with many words. You are given a word as an input and you have to find every anagram of that word in the file.
     <br/>
     Q2: Given two words, tell if they are anagrams or not. Extend your solution for unicode as well.
    </p><p>
     Finally after a long wait of almost 8 hours the result came and I was hired!!

          I am not able to understand round 3 q1. Can someone please explain what exactly needs to be done here?
         </p><p>
            if I give you an example of a binary tree:
            <br/>
            1
            <br/>
            /
            <br/>
            2  3
            <br/>
            this gets converted to:
            <br/>
            1
            <br/>
            /
            <br/>
            1 3
            <br/>
            /  /
            <br/>
            2  3
            <br/>
            /
            <br/>
            2
           </p><p>
          R3Q2 , what is the time complexity of N-queen problem..? I guess it is NP -hard ..
         </p><p>
          in R4-Q1, were the intervals sorted in any order?
          <br/>
          What was the complexity of the solution you gave?
         </p><p>
            No, they were not sorted. Youll have to sort them. The order would be nlogn
           </p><p>
          I didnt get the 2nd coding question of round 1. What is the program expected to do ?
         </p><p>
            Thats the exact question that was provided. Spend some time youll get it. I can provide you a test case.
            <br/>
            Lets say you have $4 in the start and you start betting with $1 win the first bet, lose the next two and win the next one. Finally the amount that youll have with you will be:
            <br/>
            $4(initial)+$1(win)-$1(lose)-$2(lose)+$4(win)
           </p><p>
              Does that mean program is expected to return the amount at the end of the given gaming streak ?
             </p><p>
                yup
               </p><p>
          R2.Q1:
          <br/>
          HashMap is just part of the solution, you need an sum[] as well
         </p><p>
          public static void findSubArraySumEqualToZero(int[] A) {
         </p><p>
          if (A == null || A.length == 0) {
         </p><p>
          return;
         </p><p>
          }
         </p><p>
          int[] sum = new int[A.length];
         </p><p>
          // init
         </p><p>
          sum[0] = A[0];
         </p><p>
          for (int i = 1; i &lt; A.length; i++) {
         </p><p>
          sum[i] = sum[i-1] + A[i];
         </p><p>
          }
         </p><p>
          HashMap&lt;Integer, ArrayList&gt; map = new HashMap&lt;Integer, ArrayList&gt;();
         </p><p>
          for (int i = 0; i &lt; sum.length; i++) {
         </p><p>
          int s = sum[i];
         </p><p>
          if (s == 0) {
         </p><p>
          System.out.println(String.format("A[%s – %s]", 0, i));
         </p><p>
          } else {
         </p><p>
          if (map.containsKey(s)) {
         </p><p>
          ArrayList array = map.get(s);
         </p><p>
          for (Integer position : array) {
         </p><p>
          System.out.println(String.format("A[%s – %s]", position+1, i));
         </p><p>
          }
         </p><p>
          // process
         </p><p>
          array.add(i);
         </p><p>
          map.put(s, array);
         </p><p>
          } else {
         </p><p>
          ArrayList array = new ArrayList();
         </p><p>
          array.add(i);
         </p><p>
          map.put(s, array);
         </p><p>
          }
         </p><p>
          }
         </p><p>
          }
         </p><p>
          }
         </p><p>
            Your solution works only if sum has to be of consecutive elemenets. But question does not have such constraint.
            <br/>
            Can anyone tell me whether consecutive elements are required or not ?
            <br/>
            If we have to find sum for consecutive elements then it has straight forward answer.
           </p><p>
              Yes, the elements are conituous
             </p><p>
              yes, as its said "contiguous subarray"
             </p><p>
              if its not "contiguous subarray", you need to use DP which will require Time: O(n^3) , Space: O(n^2)
             </p><p>
          How can u solve q1. from round 2 using hashMap ? I think we need to use DP.
         </p><p>
            Yes, you do need to use DP. Here are the steps:
            <br/>
            Lets suppose we have the array stored in ar[] and we declare a second array ar1[], now
           </p><p>
            step1: for i from 0 to n-1:
            <br/>
            store in ar1[] sum from ar[0] to ar[i]
            <br/>
            step 2: find the first element in the array ar1[] that repeats and the indices of that element.
            <br/>
            step 3: return the indicies.
           </p><p>
            Hashtable can be used to find the first element that repeats.
           </p><p>
            Example: Lets say the array (ar[]) is {1,4,5,-9,8,-8}
            <br/>
            now ar1[] will be {1,5,10,1,9,1}
            <br/>
            we observe that 1 occurs at indices 0 and 3, thus the array sum ‘0 is achieved from 1 to 3 which is returned.
           </p><p>
              Consider array: 4 8 -1 5 -3
              <br/>
              Resultant sub array should be: 4 -1 -3
             </p><p>
              Using your approach,
              <br/>
              ar={4,8,-1,5,-3}
              <br/>
              ar1 = {4,12,11,16,13}
             </p><p>
              Here no elements repeat.
              <br/>
              How would you get the result?
             </p><p>
                Sorry for the confusion. Its a contiguous subarray. I have asked them to fix it.
               </p><p>
                  dude, I spent 1 hour thinking how to solve it.
                 </p><p>
                  Sorry, my bad.
                  <img alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" src="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif"/>
                 </p><p>
              Its a bit late I think, but youre missing the case where the subarray starts from index 0, it never returns a value stored in the hashtable before, it only returns a 0.
             </p><p>
          Which college ?
         </p><p>
            the previous article and this one are both by iit patna students.
           </p><p>
              No! ISM Dhanbad!

          How to use hashtable for round 2 Q1?
         </p><p>
            Theres a predefined class Hashtable in java.util. I coded using that!
           </p><p>
              @Vishehsh, Is elements have to be consecutive or not ?
             </p><p>
                Yes, contiguous members.

          longest path with one bend is same as diameter?????

            2       3
           </p><p>
            then answer is 3??u r giving as 1 its wrong…..
           </p><p>
            Its same as diameter of tree
           </p><p>
              My bad,,its not same as diameter…but still urs is wrng n also 0(n^2)
             </p><p>
                in which case will this be wrong?
                <br/>
                for
                <br/>
                1
                <br/>
                2 3, 1 is the correct answer..
               </p><p>
                also i dont think this is O(n^2)
                <br/>
                could you post a better solution to this problem?
               </p><p>
                  may be m misinterprating problem..wat exactly one bend means….???
                  <br/>
                  for       tree
                  <br/>
                  1
                  <br/>
                  2                     3
                 </p><p>
                  one bend means only one curve is allowed???so 2-1 is straight line then a curve from 1-3 means one bend..so total nodes is 3 ith 1 as root…please correct me if m missing anythng in problem..isnt ur sol. means no bend…….
                 </p><p>
                  n for compelxity if we have left skew tree as.
                 </p><p>
                  1 2 3 4 5
                  <br/>
                  pre order of left skew….
                 </p><p>
                  so u will call for 1 n cover all nodes..then for 2 ,then for 3…
                 </p><p>
                  0(n^2)
                 </p><p>
                  please correct if m wrng
                 </p><p>
                  Sorry, I think I did not understand the question..
                 </p><p>
                  same here:)…request to author to post solution/example
                 </p><p>
          wat approach for add 3 LL……
         </p><p>
          We have a simple approach for adding two LL..
          <br/>
          can we use that?
         </p><p>
          ((l1+l2)+l3)
         </p><p>
          We cant traverse 3 ll simultaneously??
         </p><p>
          anyone ???
         </p><p>
            I think we can simply reverse all the three ll.After reversing add trailing zeroes to the lists which are smaller in length and add them:-
            <br/>
            like this:-
            <br/>
            1-2-&gt;3
            <br/>
            4&gt;5
            <br/>
            6-&gt;7-&gt;8-&gt;9
           </p><p>
            wil become:-
           </p><p>
            3-&gt;2-&gt;1&gt;-0
            <br/>
            5-&gt;4&gt;0-&gt;0
            <br/>
            9&gt;-8-&gt;7&gt;6
            <br/>
            ——————
            <br/>
            7-&gt;5-&gt;9&gt;6   //calculate sum and carry and propagate carry to next digits
            <br/>
            ————–
            <br/>
            6-&gt;9-&gt;5-&gt;6 = Ans
           </p><p>
              hmm….we need to revrser ans also..and their is no need to trailing ,,if any lit head become NULL it means simply list is empty…no need to add its sum.:)
             </p><p>
          This code works . Let me know if there is any issue.

            thanks for sharing the link
           </p><p>
            Thanks.. looks like a good approach..
           </p><p>
          what is the approach for "Deepest left leaf of a binary tree" ?
         </p><p>
            keep looking left, till you hit a blank..
           </p><p>
            public Node getDeepLeft(Node root)
            <br/>
            {
            <br/>
            if(root==null)
            <br/>
            return;
            <br/>
            return getDeepLeft(root.getLeft());
            <br/>
            }
           </p><p>
              Your approach is completely flawed, what if the left leaf Node is the left child of a node which itself is a rightchild , As an example consider the array [1,4,2] making a BST in order. So 2 will be the left child of 4 , and 4 would be the right child of 1. Your approach will return 1 or NULL , whereas the right answer will be 2
             </p><p>
                Valid point. My bad. I will try to post a complete solution.

                {
               </p><p>
                maxHt=left.height;
               </p><p>
                maxLeftNode=left;
               </p><p>
                q.add(left);
               </p><p>
                }

                if(right!=null)
               </p><p>
                q.add(right);
               </p><p>
                }
               </p><p>
                maxLeft Node has the required node at the end of the cycle
               </p><p>
            Basically you have to find the leaf which is a left child of its parent and has the highest depth. I used a static variable which stored the deepest leaf found until now. If the leaf in question was a left child and had a depth greater than the one already found I updated the static variable.

              @2949bb722e5c8d64e45a347ac780a52e:disqus its size is the height of tree  and its initial values are NULL
             </p><p>
            really striking idea, hashing based on heights!! we can use Open Hashing or Separate Chaining to maintain same valued (based on height) nodes. This way it will automatically link all the same ordered nodes.

          Were you able to code 3 stacks solution in time limit ?
          <br/>
          If so, which approach did you code .Please do reply !!
         </p><p>
            ye..2 stack is easy..but 3 stack to have dynamic size is a bit difficult..plz tell approach
           </p><p>
            No I only coded the static size one. I started to write code for the third approach Ive mentioned below, but he asked me to leave it and moved to the question.
           </p><p>
          Yes.Lot of info is missing. Please give examples and also discuss a bit abou approach.m not getting it
         </p><p>
          Dont just blatter out questions here .if you dont have enough time for writing detailed questons, den why bother writing at all . -_-
         </p><p>
            The fact that he posted the questions is more than enough, he is not obliged to post the questions on the first hand.
           </p><p>
            Well Im very conscious of wasting time, not just mine but everyone elses too. So instead of dedicating four chapters to how Romeo and Juliet fell in love and four more on how these questions were born out of curiosity between them I decided to be as direct as possible. I found this to be the best way to post and so I did.
           </p><p>
            Although, if you need any clarification with any of these questions Ill be happy to help. Just comment.
           </p><p>
          Could you give some more info on

          Hi congrats.
         </p><p>
          Pl tell approach for 3 stacks..one sol is to have 3 pointers at 0 AND N /3 and 2 /3.but it will waste space if one stack is full n other are empty ..n we want to insert in full stack….please tell aproach……
         </p><p>
          N how to print cousins , we need to print all nodes at same level except the node othwr brotger/.sister…
         </p><p>
          Say at any levwl we have 1234 n for 2 cousins are 3 4 ? Assumwthat 1 abd 2 are chikd of same parent..plz discuss approach. .

            Hi rahul,
           </p><p>
            Thanks a lot.
           </p><p>
            The interviewer asked me to list all the options possible and the pros and cons. Mostly the conversation was around three
            <br/>
            First: The one you mentioned, equal space, results in space waste
            <br/>
            Second: Moving middle portion, while the other two grow from either side, may require lots of movement when fragmented
            <br/>
            Third: Keeping an extra byte array to track which index of the original array was the one having the next element of that stack. Requires n/4 extra space.
           </p><p>
              can u please elaborate thirst using example…would be really helpfull.
             </p><p>
              rahul
             </p><p>
                ok..i think i got it….
                <br/>
                u r storing next index for every element??no fregmentation required….but why n/4???we need for each element,to store next index…like i have
                <br/>
                0123 4567 891011
                <br/>
                3 static stacks of size 4 elements.
               </p><p>
                now i fill first and middle full and third has only one element..
               </p><p>
                so now i can store data in 9th location in third stack as its a vacant space…..so we need to store it in the first stack somewhr that its first stack element..???
               </p><p>
                m i getting it ryt???please give an example for you 3rd method
               </p><p>
              Please elaborate on third approach .
             </p><p>
              Also, Were you able to come up with complete working code,fully working, for longest path with one bend ?
             </p><p>
          college?
         </p><p>
            IIT mandi possibly !!

        Amazon Interview | Set 45 (For Internship)
       </h2><p>
     Hello everyone! Recently I sat for an on-campus internship recruiting process of Amazon. The process consisted of a written round followed by two face to face interviews.
     <span id="more-123040">
     </span>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Written Round:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     This round consisted of 20 MCQs and two coding questions. We had to complete the test in 90 minutes. The MCQs mainly focused on C and general aptitude. They were easy to solve. The students having faster question solving skills were in advantage! The two coding questions were:
     <br/>
     1. We were given the edges of the graph and we had to find if a cycle exist in the graph or not.
     <br/>
     2. Given a binary tree, we had to print all the nodes in the Zigzag order.
     <br/>
     <a href="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/Tree.png">

     </a>
     <br/>
     For the given tree, we should print: 1324567
     <br/>
     A total of 18 students were selected for the next round from around 150+ students.

      Face to Face Interview:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     The interviewer started with the question about what projects I have done. I explained the two recent projects which I did. Then he started asking technical questions. He asked about:
     <br/>
     1. Given a sorted array which has been rotated, we have to find the point of rotation.
     <br/>
     I did it in O(n). Then he asked me to write a more optimized code. I then did it in O(log n) using modified binary search.
     <br/>
     2. About heaps, maps.
     <br/>
     3. About Job Scheduling.
     <br/>
     4. Scaling of websites as one of project was an online portal.
    </p><p>
     Then he asked me if I have any questions. I asked about how to improve. He said that I should blue practice the problems more and more. I should work more on algorithms rather than solving the problems relating to the limitations of any language. He even emphasized on the fact that companies like Amazon are looking for the students having good knowledge of algorithms. He even mentioned that GeeksforGeeks is a perfect site for preparing for companies like Amazon.
    </p><p>
     I was not lucky enough to be selected in the 2nd round of the interview but it was a motivating experience.

     to see his credentials and understand what made him standout.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      1. Can you briefly describe your background?
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     I hail from Visakhapatnam, a city in Andhra Pradesh. I ended up with an AIR 6025 in IIT and an AIR 1745 in AIEEE. Now, I am pursuing my B Tech final year in Computer Science and Engineering at NIT Trichy. My dad works for the Government and my mom is a homemaker. Prior to engineering, I was not any different from other Indian kids. As I entered NIT, I quickly grabbed some interest into Computers and worked my way through to get into a Computer Club at college (called DELTA). Apart from this, I am into many other teams at college conducting and organizing events/fests. I am the Marketing Chairman for NIT Trichys International Cultural Festival, Festember. I pursued research on "Parallel Algorithms – Task Assignment" for some time and I am expecting to publish a paper on this topic very soon.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      2. Can you describe the complete hiring process? Did your internship help you grab this offer?
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     Amazon came to our campus to hire interns. The Selection Process consisted of a written test, programming test followed by two interviews. We were tested on Data Structures, Algorithms and OOP Concepts during the interviews. I did an intern at Amazon in the summer of 2013 post which I have been offered a Pre-Placement Offer from them.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      3. What project did you work on during your internship?
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     Amazon, as all of us know is a giant in e-commerce. Something very astonishing about Amazon is the scale at which they function. At some points the servers at Amazon need to handle something close to 10,000 orders per minute. So in this company, speed and complexity handling is a great challenge considering the scale at which they function.
    </p><p>
     My project was along the same lines – I had to bring down the running time of a "process" [confidential and cannot be disclosed] from 2 to 4 hours to something close to 15 minutes. I used AWS and Java Technologies to achieve the same.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      4. What were the tricky questions you encountered? How did you tackle them?
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     I was questioned on Data Structures, Algorithms, OOPs and other basic concepts. I still remember one question in which they asked me to choose a favorite game and give an OOP model for the same. This is something real and application of what we read in books. This involved a lot of thinking and I liked the way they asked it. Apart during the intern I required concepts from Operating System, Threads, Basic Algos and DBMS to complete my project.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      5. How much preparation did you put in to get this opportunity?
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     I should say I dint put any focused preparation for the above. I went with the flow, grabbed all opportunities to learn and innovate. I feel what companies look for is an overall well developed person. So I guess my involvement into a lot of clubs and activities, decent tech knowledge and my projects got me this opportunity.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      6. What is your advice to other aspirants looking for similar opportunity?
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     Technically, get to know all basics of Algos, DS, OS, DBMS, Networks etc. I would recommend interview designed books like "Cracking the Coding Interview" by Gayle Lakmann and "DataStructures and Algorithms" by Narasimha Karumanchi. Apart one great opinion I have is, it is just not enough to be a good coder, develop in all aspects – Have a decent pointer, grab all opportunities (you have a lot of them in IITs and NITs), get social, learn some tech, do some cool projects and any company would be more than happy to have you with them.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      7. What should one keep in mind while preparing a resume?
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     A resume is one page reflection of YOU. It is important to customize a resume for companies. For eg Research projects would interest Microsoft R&amp;D profile and Coding projects would attract Facebook or Google.  And one thing I find in most resumes is people put a lot of unnecessary stuff. No one out there really bothers if you had won some Bronze medal in a quiz when you were in 6th Class at School Level.  Get to real stuff. Put yourself into a shoe of a recruiter and think what you would look for in a resume.  And it is very important to proof read your resume. Having spelling mistakes on a resume could be a blunder.

        Amazon Interview | Set 44 (For Internship)
       </h2><p>
     The written round was relatively easy. It contained 20 multiple choice questions on basic c, algorithms and finite automata. Some questions from OS and networking were there too but were easy. Coding questions were:
     <span id="more-123034">
     </span>
     <br/>
     1. Find the nodes of the tree as seen from the left view of the binary tree.
     <br/>
     2. Rotate the given matrix by 90 degrees i.e. the first row becomes the last column and second row becomes the second last column and so on.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Interview round 1:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Two questions were asked. One puzzle and the other coding question.
     <br/>
     1. Given n coins for two players playing a game. Each player picks coins from the given n coins in such a way that he can pick 1 to 5 coins in one turn and the game continues for both the players. The player who picks the last coin looses the game. You have to tell that for given n coins who looses the game?
    </p><p>
     2. Given a number n, find the number just greater than n using same digits as that of n.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Interview round 2:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1. Given in facebook find an efficient way to find the mutual friends between you and one of your given friends.
     <br/>
     Hint: hashing, dictionary data structure implementation
    </p><p>
     2. For two very long numbers given, find the product of these numbers in an efficient way.
     <br/>
     Hint: using binary multiplication effectively.
    </p><p>
     Finally I got internship offer from them….:)

    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 2: Written
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1. Find the SQRT of a number.
    </p><p>
     2. Simulate Reversed level order traversal.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Three F2Fs.
     </strong>
     <br/>
     F2F 1:
     <br/>
     1. Given a binary tree, no two adjacent nodes have same color, but all leaves should be in same color. You can fill only with two colors. Write a function to find whether a given tree can be colored using above scenario.
    </p><p>
     2. Given a binary tree, change the right pointer of every leaf node to the next leaf node (right to it but may be on different level).
    </p><p>
     3. Given a class with n people,where each people plays a game with all other people. Results are with you. You have to arrange them in a queue with a condition that, a[i] should have won a[i-1], for all I, you dont need to care about a[i-2] . (a[i] may win or lose a[i-2]).
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      F2F 2:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1. Write prime numbers from 1 to 100000.
    </p><p>
     2. Another simple question from tree. cant remember
     <img alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" src="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif"/>
    </p><p>
     3. Question from probability. Given c containers, r red balls, g green balls. Give a condition that if a guy randomly pick a ball from any of the containers, it should be red.(more probable)
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      F2F 3:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1. Reverse a linked list iteratively, recursively.(Ice breaking question :P)
    </p><p>
     2. Given a matrix with 1s and 0s, u have to construct a matrix such that a[i][j]=1, if only every element in ith row and jth column is 1, otherwise 0. You have to use constant space and O(mn) time complexity.
    </p><p>
     3. Maze solve problem. Given a matrix with 1s and 0s, 0 represents free path, 1 represents blocked area, and you can move in any of the 8 directions. Find the path from source to destination and print it. Then he told me that he can change destination at run time. And asked me to do for that.

        Amazon Interview | Set 41 (On–campus)
       </h2><p>
     The first round had 20 multiple choice questions covering C programming, Data structures, Algorithms, Maths and puzzles, and a question from Networking and Operating systems.
     <span id="more-122905">
     </span>
     The duration of the test was of 90 minutes and marking scheme was +1, -0.25
    </p><p>
     It also had 2 coding questions.
     <br/>
     <strong>
      i)
     </strong>
     Given an array of numbers, find the minimum value of the absolute difference that can be obtained from any pair of numbers from the array.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      ii)
     </strong>
     Find the first non-repeated character in a string. If there are no such chars then return -1.
    </p><p>
     There were 4 rounds of technical interview, no HR round. Following are the major questions asked to me in the tech rounds. I had to first suggest the logic, discuss that with the interviewer and then he asked me to code it up.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 1 –
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1) Check if a given tree is a Binary Search Tree or not. Simple enough question.
    </p><p>
     2) You are given an array whose each element represents the height of the tower. The width of every tower is 1. It starts raining. How much water is collected between the towers?
     <br/>
     Eg. [1,5,3,7,2] – then answer is 2 units between towers 5 and 7.
     <br/>
     Looks easy, but if you dont observe well, then you might end up with the wrong logic like I did at first. Also there are lots of possible corner cases. Luckily I could identify them all.
    </p><p>
     3) Given an array and a fixed window size X, you have to find out the minimum value from every window. De-queue was not allowed. So I had to do it using 2 stacks.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 2 –
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1) Some DBMS questions like how is database stored in memory,how an image stored in database and a few more questions from it.
    </p><p>
     2) What is a height balanced tree. Give an O(n) solution to balance it. Then he changed the definition of a balanced tree as- a tree is balanced if every node in a particular level should have the same number of descendants (and not only direct children). And every node can have any number of children. I had to design the class and then write the code for it.
    </p><p>
     3) Given an array of integers, find an index such that if you split the array into two parts the absolute value of the difference between the sum of elements in both parts had to be minimum. After giving him the logic, he changed it to split it into 3 parts such that sum of elements in all of them are equal. I had to code this one.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 3 –
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1) There is a sentence that your friend knows, but while giving it to you, he lost all the spaces. You have to dictionary with you. How would you reconstruct the original sentence using it.
    </p><p>
     2) How to delete a particular node from a circular Linked list.
    </p><p>
     3) You are given an encrypted file. You dont know the key used to encrypt it. Like A might be mapped to B, B to some D and D to some other F. But you dont know this encryption scheme. You have the dictionary with you. How will you decrypt the file? I suggested lots of solution like exhaustive searching, then using some variants to minimize the complexity. He gave me just a one word hint- histogram. So I gave him a logic that counting the frequency of every letter used in the dictionary. Then replace the most used letter in the file with the most used in the dictionary. And then compare words with the dictionary. In case of a mismatch back –track and use the second largest and so on. I also discussed with him that it could also have high complexity in worst case, but he moved on.
    </p><p>
     4) What is indexing in DBMS. How will you implement an index.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 4 -
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1) A complete path in a tree is from a root to a leaf. A k-heavy path is a complete path whose sum of elements is greater than k. Write a code to delete all nodes which are not in any of the k-heavy paths.
    </p><p>
     2) You have an array whose elements firstly strictly increase and then strictly decrease. You have to find the point of change.
    </p><p>
     All the questions in all the rounds required the minimum possible complexity possible (both time and space). And I had to write the code of my final solution as well. Finally the results came and I was selected by them.

        Amazon Interview | Set 48 (On-campus for SDE-1)
       </h2><p>
     Recently, I have been through the interview experience of Amazon India and I would like to share my experience with everyone.

    </p><p>
     Position: SDE- 1
    </p><p>
     No. of Interviews: 1 Written + 4 PI
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Day 1:
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 1 : (Written)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     20 MCQ questions consisting of Data Structure, Algorithms, Operating Systems, Probability, Combinatorics and Quatitative Analysis.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Coding Problems :
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1. A string consists of parentheses and letters. Write a program to validate all the parentheses. Ignore the letters.
     <br/>
     eg. ((alf)ls) – valid
     <br/>
     )(dkk)() – invalid
    </p><p>
     2. You are involved in a betting game whose rules are as follows :
     <br/>
     a) if you win a round, the bet amount will be added to your sum and next bet amount will be $1;
     <br/>
     b) if you lose a round, the bet amount will be reduced from your total sum and next bet will be twice the previous.
     <br/>
     c) game ends when all the rounds are complete or you dont have sufficient sum.
     <br/>
     Initially, you are given with a string of the form "WLWWL" where W indicates a win and L indicates a loss and initial sum. Initial bet amount will be $1.
    </p><p>
     Function prototypes and main was given for both questions.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 2 : (Face to Face)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Some discussion on my projects, and then a couple of questions.
     <br/>
     1. An array of integers is given, find all the ranges present in the array.
     <br/>
     eg. 1 6 4 2 3 — ranges will be {1-4} and {6}.
     <br/>
     I used sorting to solve this problem, so some follow up questions about which sorting technique i would prefer here.
     <br/>
     What is the difference between merge sort and quick sort and when quick sort is preferred over merge sort, etc.
    </p><p>
     2. Two strings are given. One of them is the initial string and other string contains characters as per their priority. Sort the initial string as per the given second string. characters in initial string may or may not be present in the second string. If not present, sort them in lexicographical order at the end of output.
     <br/>
     eg. String1 – ddloyc, String2 – odl
     <br/>
     Output – oddlcy
     <br/>
     Again, some discussion over various approaches to solve this problem.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 3 : (Face to Face)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Discussions over my projects.
     <br/>
     1. (Reservoir sampling problem) http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reservoir-sampling/
     <br/>
     2. Generate all valid permutations of n pair of parenthesis.
     <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-all-combinations-of-balanced-parentheses/" target="_blank">
      http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-all-combinations-of-balanced-parentheses/
     </a>
     <br/>
     3. Given a bst, update the value of every node with sum of value of all nodes greater than and equal to the value of current node.
     <br/>
     Counter Question : I had used global variable for this purpose, so he asked me to solve it without any global or static     variable.
     <br/>
     4. Inorder Successor of a node in bst.
     <br/>
     5. Given a list and a number k, invert first k elements and leave next k elements. Repeat this throughout the list.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 4 : (Face to Face)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1. N number of jars are kept in a linear fashion. Each jar contains a color whose value ranges from 0-99. Now you can mix any two adjacent jars having colors ‘a and ‘b (both integers), and it will produce a new color of the value (a+b) mod 100 and will also produce smoke with value (a*b). Mix all the jars in a way such that in the end only one jar remains and total smoke produced is minimum.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Day 2 :
     </strong>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Round 4 : (Telephonic with someone very senior)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     He said that i must have been through many coding questions already, so he will start with the basics.
     <br/>
     1. What is the difference between C and C++ ?
     <br/>
     2. Which one will you prefer, when and why?
     <br/>
     3. What is the difference between C++ and JAVA.
     <br/>
     4. Which is better, C++ or JAVA. Support your answer.
     <br/>
     5. Give one use case where C/C++ can use pointers to solve it, but it cant be done in Java.
     <br/>
     6. Again, some discussion over my projects. Which project i liked most and why? What problems did i face during that
     <br/>
     project and how i handled them.
     <br/>
     7. Given a stream of 0s and 1s in which 0s come first and then 1s, find the first occurrence of 1.
     <br/>
     8. Design a data structure for phone-book of mobile phones. Implement it and discuss about its benefits and limitations.
    </p><p>
     In the evening they announced the result and i was hired!!!

    </p><p>
     Suggestions :- Write a neat code with indentations. Its a good idea to mention all the test cases(in case of an algorithmic problem) and all the use cases(if needed to design a data structure) beforehand. And, dont just respond to the questions of the interviewer, try to interact with them.

          can you give answer of 7th question in round 4??
         </p><p>
            I know the simple way to iterate through the stream but there might be a better approach.
           </p><p>
              I think we can use binary search
             </p><p>
              -Start from 1, keep doubling the interval unless you encounter first 1. Then Binary search in that last interval.
              <br/>
              -Or direct Binary search from 1-n.
             </p><p>
            use binary search iterate till the element is 1 and the previous element is zero
           </p><p>
            use binary search and iterate till the element found is q and the previous element is zero
           </p><p>
              it is 1 not q

     b) Given a BT check if there is a BST in it. If it exists print the largest BST in the BT.
    </p><p>
     c)Given a large file with huge number of words group the anagrams of a word
     <br/>
     hai how are you. iahohw done woh.
     <br/>
     o/p:
     <br/>
     hai -&gt;iah
     <br/>
     how -&gt;woh -&gt;ohw
     <br/>
     done
     <br/>
     are
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      2nd F2F round:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     a) Given a linked list , print the nth last node. He asked me to give the optimised solution for it.
     <br/>
     solved using slow pointer.
    </p><p>
     b) Find the LCA in Binary Tree
     <br/>
     He asked me to optimise the code with bottom up approach and gave lots of boundary conditions
    </p><p>
     c) Given a zigzag traversal construct a tree from it. Full working code was asked.
    </p><p>
     Solved it with double ended queue.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      3rd F2F round :
     </strong>
     <br/>
     a) Given a chess board of finite length , start postion of a knight , an end position.
     <br/>
     -&gt;find whether the end position is reachable by the knight.
     <br/>
     -&gt; Number of minimum hops required to reach that position.
     <br/>
     I came up with a BFS solution instantly . He posed several conditions in the same question as I have seen the question already.
    </p><p>
     b) He changed the question to infinite length chess board and if given two knights in a chess board .find minimum hops required for them meet.
     <br/>
     -&gt;gave a lot of space and time constraints.
     <br/>
     -&gt;asked me to write the complete code without STL.
    </p><p>
     c) if we encode A-1 , B-2 , C-3 , I send a word CAMP encoded as 311316. It can be decoded as 3 11 3 16 (CKCP), 3 1 1 3 16(CAACP) , 3 1 1 3 1 6 , (CAACAF) . given a input encoded string find the no. ways it can be decoded.   (ACODE prob. in Spoj)
     <br/>
     311316 – 4
     <br/>
     -&gt;Could nt come up with DP solution at first so gave a solution with recursion tree. He asked me to optimise to avoid unnecessary computations.. Finally Solved it using DP.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      4th F2F round ( Bar Raiser Round):
     </strong>
     <br/>
     The Round started with the projects I have done so far. Few basic questions in cloud computing. I have used Amazon Web Service (AWS) in one of my projects.
     <br/>
     a) Lots of questions on AWS . Why we used it when there are so many alternatives.
     <br/>
     b) When i convinced him with scalability issues, he posed questions on how AWS handle load Balancing and scalability issues .
     <br/>
     c) Obviously questions on Elastic Map Reduce and Elastic Block Storage. Questions piled up until I could explain every nook and corner in that project.
     <br/>
     d) Strengths and Weakness.
     <br/>
     e) Why Amazon and why do I leave my previous company within 2 months.
    </p><p>
     f) Given a linked list with random pointers , clone the linked list.
     <br/>
     Gave few solutions and he asked me to clone without manipulating the original linked list but with extra space. Came up with little tweaks using HashMap
     <br/>
     Map&lt; node * , node *&gt;  key is the node and value is the random ptr node.
    </p><p>
     g) Find the ceil and floor of a value in a given BST without extra space.
     <br/>
     if a BST contains 1 3 6 7 9 12
     <br/>
     -&gt;if the given value is 8 floor is 7 and ceil is 9.
     <br/>
     -&gt;if the given value is 9 both floor and ceil is 9.
     <br/>
     P.S. Be cautious in explaining your projects.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      5th F2F round: (Hiring Manager Round):
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Few questions on projects and advantages of AWS.
     <br/>
     a) Asked me about the different inter process communication methods.
     <br/>
     b) Which method is faster and why. Then he asked me to explain about shared memory
    </p><p>
     c) Asked to write the code to implement LRU cache.
     <br/>
     d) Then code for malloc implementation given an array.
    </p><p>
     e) He asked me to write a thread safe code for the given scenario.
     <br/>
     given two writer threads and two reader threads . give a mechanism to handle the writer and reader threads. The writer thread writes a value 1 2 3 4 in a queue or array and  reader thread reads it and print the output as 1 , 2 ,3 ,4 …..In the same order as given and only once…
     <br/>
     -&gt;i handled it with a binary semaphore and a single queue for both reader and writer..
     <br/>
     f) conditions for a deadlock and he asked me to associate with the real life scenario.
     <br/>
     mutual exclusion and all the cases.
     <br/>
     g) Different types of scheduling and what type of scheduler does linux have and why.
     <br/>
     h) doeslinux have preemptive scheduling and few questions on virtual memory.
     <br/>
     He just analysed my approach towards the problem and checked my basic understanding in OS concepts.
    </p><p>
     Finally got offer from Amazon after two days. I owe a great thanks to GeeksForGeeks. It helped me a lot to improve my data structure and problem solving skills. Hope this will help you. All the Best .

<h2>
        Amazon Interview | Set 37
       </h2><p>
     Interview Experience for placements at AMAZON.
     <br/>
     It consists of 1 online round (20 MCQ + 2 coding question) and 4 F2F interviews.
     <span id="more-121831">
     </span>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Online Round 1:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     20 MCQ 1 question each from OS, pigeon hole principle, probability, DBMS, networks, NP problem and other questions from C/C++ input output and logical question
    </p><p>
     22 from batch out of 300 students were selected for F2F interviews
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Interview Round 1:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     As they were short in time as it was 9 at night so they asked me single coding question.
     <br/>
     Que 1: Given an array of n numbers with repetition of numbers. You need to find the max length of continuous sub array with at max 3 unique elements.
     <br/>
     For eg
     <br/>
     array: 1 2 3 1 4 3 4 1 2
     <br/>
     ans: 6 (3 1 4 3 4 1)
     <br/>
     Solution: Time complexity O(n)
     <br/>
     Extra Space O(1)
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Interview Round 2:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     They asked me 3 questions but I am not remembering the 2nd one. Sorry for that
     <br/>
     Que 1: You are given two binary trees. You need to tell that if one tree is rotated 90 degree and placed at bottom of that tree and  each leaf nodes at max depth of two trees will meet each other or not.
     <br/>
     for eg:
     <br/>
     lets assume () as a node
     <br/>
     Tree 1
    </p><p>
     So it returns true as node 4, 5 of tree 1 is overlapping with node 4 of tree 2
     <br/>
     Firstly I was asked to give algorithm then when i gave he asked me to code it
     <br/>
     Solution: Time Complexity O(n+m) (where n and m are nodes in tree 1 and tree 2 respectively). Space Complexity O(n+m)
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Que 3:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Suppose u given normal deck of cards 4 suites and 13 cards of each suite in which one card is missing
     <br/>
     you are picking a card one at a time and sees that card and putting it aside
     <br/>
     Find the suite and number of missing card.
     <br/>
     Then he said change the number of suites to K (very very large you cant add till k)
     <br/>
     and N numbers (again very large numbers)
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Interview Round 3:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     It was an easy round for me atleast but not for others
     <br/>
     Que 1: Find the palindrome of a given number without using extra space
    </p><p>
     Que 2: 100 floors and 2 egg problem changed to 50 floors and 2 eggs
    </p><p>
     Que 3: You are given array of numbers which increasing first then decreasing. Find the greates number.
     <br/>
     eg: 1 2 3 4 5 4 3
     <br/>
     answer: 5
     <br/>
     Solution : Time Complexity O(logn)
     <br/>
     Space Complexity O(1)
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Interview Round 4:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     He asked me about my myself apart from coding and as I said "Hacking" so we discussed about hacking a lot.
     <br/>
     He also aksed me about my projects
     <br/>
     Then he gave me a puzzle:
     <br/>
     Assuming I have a chessboard (8X8)
     <br/>
     a knight is placed at (x,y) and he moves N hops
     <br/>
     Find the probabilty that he will be inside after N hops.
     <br/>
     On a condition that if a knight moves outside then he will remain outside he cant come inside.
     <br/>
     For eg. (x,y)=(0,0)
     <br/>
     n=2
     <br/>
     probabilty=(12/64)
    </p><p>
     4th round was type of HR as he wants to know about myself and how I do different things.
     <br/>
     If I stuck in a position what will I do.
     <br/>
     If your boss says that you have to do X and you are not satisfied with this then what will you do and how will you approach.
    </p><p>
     After that I waited for 3 hours and I got selected with 4 of my friends
     <img alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" src="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif"/>
    </p><p>
     Hope this will help, I try the possible way to support you.
    </p><p>
     All the best for your placements

          Can you please explain your approach to question 1 of interview round 1. How do you did it with O(1) space??
         </p><p>
          Interview 1 Question: 3 Suppose u given normal deck of cards 4 suites and 13 cards of each suite in which one card is missing
          <br/>
          you are picking a card one at a time and sees that card and putting it aside.Find the suite and number of missing card.
          <br/>
          Then he said change the number of suites to K (very very large you cant add till k) and N numbers (again very large numbers).
         </p><p>
          Solution: Suppose there are K suites and each having N cards, lets assume card numbers are 1,2,3,…N.
         </p><p>
          Create a map of size K from suite number to cards total.
          <br/>
          Pick up a card, suppose it is from suite k with number n, then update map(k) = map(k) + n.
         </p><p>
          Once all cards are completed, you will get only one entry in map whose sum is less than (1+2+3+…13) and rest all are having entry of (1+2+…13), Now you know how to get missing number from a list of numbers from 1 to N with only one missing number

          Interview Round 1: Que 1:
          <br/>
          Given an array of n numbers with repetition of numbers. You need to find the max length of continuous sub array with at max 3 unique elements.
         </p><p>
          Solution:
          <br/>
          1. StartIndex = 0, CurrentIndex =0
          <br/>
          2. Start CurrentIndex, move position of CurrentIndex as long as the array from StartIndex to CurrentIndex contains at max 3 elements
          <br/>
          3. If 2 voilates, Store current length of array from StartIndex to CurrentIndex as so far max array length found, Then
          <br/>
          move StartIndex as long as we maintain 3 elements at max between StartIndex to CurrentIndex and repeat the same procedure.
         </p><p>
          post questions of GS too.

        Amazon Interview | Set 38 (SDE-I)
       </h2><p>
     <strong>
      1) (Telephonic round 1)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     a. Print a matrix in spiral order (Code)
     <span id="more-121990">
     </span>
     <br/>
     Soln: Solved it using recursion. Each recursive call was suppose to print boundary elements. On every recursive call, shifted the origin point and passed new size of matrix.
     <br/>
     b. Given a pair of brace {}. Validate it. (Code)
     <br/>
     Soln: using two variables (i.e open_count and close_count) and proceed further.
     <br/>
     c. What if we have multiple types of braces? (Approach)
     <br/>
     Soln: Using stack.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      2) (Telephonic round 2)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     a. Given list of songs. How would you shuffle it? (Code)
     <br/>
     Soln: Gave various approaches from naive to optimal. The optimal one was similar to shuffling of array of ints.
     <br/>
     b. Give list of words. Print all anagrams together. (Code)
     <br/>
     Soln: Used Hashmap with key as "sort(str[i])" and value as List which is anagrams.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      3) 3: In-house 1
     </strong>
     <br/>
     There are various varieties of clothes (say shirt). Varieties are based on parameters like pattern, size, colour, etc.
     <br/>
     a. What will be your input format so that it can store all values of all parameters?
     <br/>
     List&lt;List&lt;String&gt;&gt;. Each List&lt;String&gt; denotes values for a particular parameter
     <br/>
     b. Design a class for a shirt for the same requirement.
     <br/>
     c. You have to return all different types of shirts that can be formed based on various combinations of input parameters. (Code)
     <br/>
     d. Assuming you have all types of shirts available. Now there are various queries like:
     <br/>
     i. Show all types of shirt having colour "red",
     <br/>
     ii. Show all types of shirt having size "small" and pattern "check" etc. etc.
     <br/>
     So how will you store I/P so that this requirement can be fulfilled efficiently?
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      4) In-house 2
     </strong>
     <br/>
     a. Given a Binary Tree. Assuming each node denotes some x,y coordinate. root node denotes (0,0). Write a code to display coordinate of all nodes.
     <br/>
     case (i): Tree is complete and no nodes x-coordinate is overlapping. (i.e all nodes will expand along x-axis so that no node overlaps). (Code)
    </p><p>
     Here we can see that many nodes are overlapping over x-cordinate.
    </p><p>
     case (ii): Tree is incomplete and no nodes x-coordinate is overlapping. (Approach)
     <br/>
     case (iii): Tree is incomplete and nodes x-coordinate can overlap. (Approach)
    </p><p>
     b. Design a DS to perform
     <br/>
     Insert
     <br/>
     Search
     <br/>
     Delete
     <br/>
     get Random
     <br/>
     All in O(1).
     <br/>
     Soln: Focus on Delete and get_Random. On further analysis, only get_Random was required to me modified. Only a bit of tweak will serve the purpose.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      5) In-house 3
     </strong>
     <br/>
     a. Given array of ints. Assuming total no. of elements is even. Need to tell whether this array can be grouped in sets of pairs such that sum of each pair is divisible by K.
     <br/>
     eg: 0,2,4,8,12,20,18,4 and k=4
     <br/>
     so (0,8), (2,18), (4,20), (4,12) is one such set in which sum of each pair is divisible by k. (Code)
    </p><p>
     b. There is a vertical rod. Discs of various radiuses are inserted in it. When we will try to take out any disc then 1st all the discs above it has to be taken out. Taking out a disc and putting it back is counted as one step.
     <br/>
     Considering this, what will be the minimum no of steps in which these discs of various radius can be stored in sorted order in the rod.
     <br/>
     Only minimum no of steps was required. "How to sort" was not required. (Approach)
    </p><p>
     c. Given array of ints. find ar[i],ar[j] such that j&gt;i and ar[j]-ar[i] is maximum. Famous problem. (Code)
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      6) (Semi Technical- Hiring Manager)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     a. Normal HR questions. Why Amazon over your previous company, some areas where you want to improve, define dream job and similar other questions as per the discussions.
     <br/>
     As per feedback: my answer for "Why Amazon over prev company" was not clear here.
    </p><p>
     b. Given two arrays of ints of size m and m+n in sorted order. merge it inplace. Famous problem. (Code)
    </p><p>
     c. Given string.
     <br/>
     Qusn: Find the char occuring max no of times.
     <br/>
     Soln: Simple one. Take auxillary array of size 256 and maintain frequency of each char. Scan auxillary array and get the required char. O(k+n) where k=256 here.
     <br/>
     Counter Qusn: Why O(k+n)? Why cant it be O(n) only?
     <br/>
     Soln: At the time of maintaining freq of each, compare to get max freq char also. No need to travel aux array again. O(n)
     <br/>
     Counter Qusn: What if memory size is only 100 bytes?
     <br/>
     Soln: Detailed one.
     <br/>
     Counter Qusn: Assuming updating freq of each char takes 1sec, so it will take N secs roughly. How can we improve it?
     <br/>
     Soln: Use multi threading for parallel programming.
     <br/>
     Counter qusn: Will there be any issue?
     <br/>
     Soln: In case one aquires lock, other one that needs lock will go in waiting. This adds extra time and so can take more than N secs.
     <br/>
     Counter Qusn: How to improve this?
     <br/>
     Soln: Detailed one.
     <br/>
     And many more such counter questions.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      7) (Amazon Seattle. Semi HR. Analysis of thought process- BAR RAISER)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     a. Again same question. Why Amazon over previous company?
     <br/>
     This time I was prepared
     <img alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" src="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif"/>
     <br/>
     b. One +ve point and one -ve point from amazon india site.
     <br/>
     c. Was prepared for this and already did some pre analysis on the site.
     <br/>
     Many more such HR questions.
     <br/>
     d. Analysis of thought process:
     <br/>
     Assuming a new building is going to be constructed for IT official purpose. 75 floors. You are builder. This building will be on lease for diff companies.
     <br/>
     i. How many lifts you will add in that building?
     <br/>
     ii. At which floor each lift will stop?
     <br/>
     Note: At each step, I had to identify the required data after analysis and then only data for the same was provided.
     <br/>
     Soln (i): (As it is totally based on thought process, so counter question from your side is good point)
     <br/>
     1. No of Lifts are determined by many factors. Major factors are height of lift and no of persons working in that building.
     <br/>
     2. I was knowing height of building. To calculate no of persons, I asked size of each floor. It was 100 sq m each floor.
     <br/>
     3. Each floor will have cubicles and other rooms and passages. Assuming 70% of total area is used by cubicles.
     <br/>
     4. Each cubicle will have 4 persons. After calculation it came to be 40 employees per floor. So 3000 employee in whole building.
     <br/>
     5. Next analysis was: In most of the IT company, the in/out timing is flexible. Generally in time is b/w 9:00-11:00 and out is b/w 5:00-7:00.
     <br/>
     6. We have 2hrs of window in which all employee will use the lift. So no of lifts will depend on this factor also.
     <br/>
     7. After calculation, it came out to be approx 9 lifts (which was a good no according to him).
     <br/>
     Soln (ii): Now the qusn is at which floor each lift will stop.
     <br/>
     8. AS we dont know how many companies will be there in this building at any time, so it is advisable to provide equal chance for employees on the basis of floor no. rather than on the basis of company.
     <br/>
     9. Best way would be to minimise the no. of stops of each lift.
     <br/>
     10. This can be done by giving each lift equal no of floors on which it will stop.
     <br/>
     11. It can simply be calculated as 75/9= 9 (round off).
     <br/>
     12. So 1st lift will have floor buttons b/w 1-9, 2nd will have b/w 10-18 and so on.
     <br/>
     13. This approach was best (according to him) for current scenario.
     <br/>
     14. Remember that each floor should get equal chance and we dont know how many companies will be there.

     ————————————-
     <br/>
     Qs-1) In a binary tree, a complete path is defined as a path from root to a leaf. The sum of all nodes on that path is defined as the sum of that path. Given a number K, we have to remove (prune the tree) nodes from the tree which lie on a path having sum less than K. A node can be part of multiple paths. So we have to delete it only in case when all paths from it have sum less than K.
     <br/>
     I was able to solve the problem with bottom up approach, and able to write a working code of it.
    </p><p>
     Q-2) Given an array of positive numbers, find the maximum sum of a subsequence with the constraint that no 2 numbers in the sequence should be adjacent in the array. So 3 2 7 10 should return 13 (sum of 3 and 10) or 3 2 5 10 7 should return 15 (sum of 3, 5 and 7).
     <br/>
     I was able to give him a DP solution with a Parent array which stores thee index of the parent of every element,i hd put -1 for the first element,at the end I backtrack the array to find the all the elements.

      TopTalent: Firstly, how do you feel when so many world class companies are trying to woo you?
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Prasoon:
     </strong>
     I am greatly overwhelmed! I never imagined such a scenario, so I am delighted that so many companies considered me worthy of an offer.  It feels good to know that I did things right. And, its always a treat to see your hard work rewarded.
    </p><p>
     All these companies are highly reputable and they are very selective in their hiring, but a lot of engineers get hired from across the world. So, its important to keep things in perspective and not get carried away. I can join just one company, so all these offers are equivalent to just one good offer. And hence, at the end of the day, I see it as a good job opportunity.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      <strong>
       TopTalent:
      </strong>
      Which company are you planning to join and how did you make that decision?
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Prasoon:
     </strong>
     Yes, that was a very tough call. It was extremely confusing. They are all top tech companies, and each had a lot to offer in terms of the role, work and responsibility. Google, given their array of products – its a crime for an engineer to decline their offer. Walmart &amp; PocketGems have quality work and good growth opportunities. Amazon also offered a very good profile. But, I chose Facebook because I feel that it is a better cultural fit for me at this stage. Even after their IPO, they are trying to preserve their startup culture, and continues to offer a lot of opportunities . That just nicked it in the end!
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      <strong>
       TopTalent:
      </strong>
      Can you give us a brief account of what you felt was the toughest interview?
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Prasoon:
     </strong>
     Its hard to pin-point a single tough interview. Each company had its own style. Facebook &amp; Pocketgems had very intense and focused rounds, revolving around coding/algo and system-design. They were looking for speed and accuracy. At Google, as can be expected, some really tough algo questions came up. I am unsure about the complete correctness of one of my solutions, even now. In another round, I was able to convince the interviewer that his solution had the same flaws as my solution. So, that was a confidence booster. Walmart though, was a bit unexpected. In a design round, my initial solution was built around a string algorithm. But, the interviewer pointed out some counter-cases. So, by relying on his hints and the counter-cases, some probabilistic techniques got incorporated into the system. At the end, the interviewer informed me that my final solution was a model in machine-learning. So, I feel that mathematical aptitude helps in more ways than just algorithm design.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      <strong>
       TopTalent:
      </strong>
      What kind of skill-set companies are looking for in candidates?
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Prasoon:
     </strong>
     Well, a strong understanding of data structures and algorithms, along with fast-and-accurate coding skills are the primary requirement. And companies pay particular attention to the quality of code -&gt; neat, short &amp; easy to understand.
    </p><p>
     Moreover, a good aptitude in Computer Science is also desired. The fundamentals of OS, DBMS, distributed systems, design patterns, etc, often get applied indirectly in the design rounds. In this regard, I feel that a basic understanding of common systems like search-engines, spell checkers, trends, etc, helps one greatly.
    </p><p>
     And, companies inherently dig for creativity. The above mentioned skills are just tools to come up with smart solutions.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      <strong>
       TopTalent:
      </strong>
      Whats your advice to students who are aiming for similar placement offers as yours?
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Prasoon:
     </strong>
     Do not get burdened by the hype surrounding these jobs. And after that, I think its extremely important to enjoy the subject and the process of preparation. In my opinion, there is an element of luck involved with interviews, and candidates must acknowledge it. Hence, they must not over-pressurize themselves. And, all wise proverbs about success strictly apply.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      <strong>
       TopTalent:
      </strong>
      What should one keep in mind while preparing a resume?
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Prasoon:
     </strong>
     One must understand that the resume is ones first impression. So, its important to be precise and accurate in terms of what one wants to convey. A lot of tips are available on the internet, and one can pay heed to them. In terms of the content, I chose to write projects that had good depth, and discard the lighter ones. I feel that this enhances the strength of the resume.
    </p><p>
     Other than these, one must prepare oneself to have a detailed discussion on everything that is mentioned in the resume.

          Thanks for posting the interview of Prasoon. It was extremely helpful.
         </p><p>
          I am unable to download resume from TopTalent.in, as it demands only Top College alumnis to login.
          <br/>
          Can you post another link where all can access easily?
         </p><p>
          Reading GFG after long time.
         </p><p>
          I have noticed one common write up in these guys,
         </p><p>
          "I think its extremely important *to enjoy the subject and the process of preparation*. In my opinion, …"
         </p><p>

        Amazon Interview | Set 25
       </h2><p>
     Hi, This is Pandu. About 1 month back I had attended Amazon Interview In hyderabad, it was total of 8 rounds which includes  2 telephonic and 6 face to face and the whole process was lasted about 25 days because of unavailability of all the interviewers.
     <span id="more-117007">
     </span>
     The whole was very painful for me as before and after attending interviews on each interviewing day, I had to spend with some tension &amp; anxiety. I was interviewed for SDE 2 position
    </p><p>
     The following are the questions:( For all the algorithmic questions , working code is required, they would take those papers and discuss in their internal meeting after all the rounds)
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Telephonic Round 1(with Lead developer):
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Q1)Given a snake and ladder game, write a function that returns the minimum number of jumps to take top or destination  position.
     <br/>
     You can assume the die you throws results in always favor of you.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Telephonic Round 2(with SDE 1): ( after 5 days of 1st telephonic)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Q1)Given an integer array and an integer value X, return two elements in that array such that sum of them equals to X.
     <br/>
     – Here he asked about different ways to solve it and pros and cons of each solution.
     <br/>
     (For Hash map solution , He was looking for getting solution in only one pass)
     <br/>
     Q2)discussion about my project details and challenging task
     <br/>
     Q3) suddenly you web application has become very slow on clicking particular URL. How would you debug it and solve the problem
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Face to Face round 1(with SDE 1):
     </strong>
     (after 4 days of 2nd telephonic. 3 faces to face rounds were taken on same day and lasted about 5 hours)
    </p><p>
     Q1) Given a sorted array and a number write a method that returns the number of occurances of given number
     <br/>
     Q2) You have given a dictionary of an alien language in which letters are same as English letters but their order is different.
     <br/>
     Your task is sort the letters or give relationship b/w letters using that disctionary. note: the dictions may conatain 1 to n words.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Face to Face Round 2(with SDE 2):
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Q1) In our project we are using Java Spring framework. He asked to implement spring container.
     <br/>
     Q2) Implement LRU caching. After that asked me two different cases (1) required element is already in chase , 2) required element in not in cache and cache is full)
     <br/>
     Had to explain those two cases by walking through your code.
     <br/>
     Q3) You are given a faulty binary serach tree in which only 2 nodes are misplaced(swapped their positions with each other). write a method
     <br/>
     that takes root of that BST and return the root of the corrected binary tree.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Face to Face Round 3 (With Lead Developer) : (Design question)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Q1) Given an URL you need to analyze all the images( they may be in 1000s of number) and return the cumulative quality of images present in that url.
     <br/>
     lets say: you can configure image quality as very good,good, average, poor..etc, so you have to return one value among them. The given URL  may conatain several othe URLs and they also conatain lot of images . you need to consider all of them. lot of questions like how to avoid visiting same url again,
     <br/>
     how would you determine the quality of an image if you encounter an url that contains only an image..etc.
     <br/>
     Q2) Design Elevator system. And then write an algorithm for that Design such that, the user request should be completed in logN time in a N story building with M elevators,
     <br/>
     This round was lasted more than 2 hours.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Face to Face Round 4 ( With Hiring Manager): ( after 5 days of last 3 f2f rounds)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Q1)Discussion about my project details
     <br/>
     Q2) Design Question: Design Clustered caching system for an web site like Amazon.com.
     <br/>
     In which millions of  web servers deployed over the globe and only one inventory  Database system
     <br/>
     Q3) Design question: Design only Train search functionality of IRCTC
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Face to Face Round 5 (With Bar Raiser):
     </strong>
     ( same day following Hiring manager interview)
     <br/>
     Q1) Discussion about my project and Challenging task
     <br/>
     Q2) Design Question: In an online teaching system,there are n number of teachers and each one teaches only one subject to any number of students.
     <br/>
     And a student can join to any number of teachers to learn those subjects.
     <br/>
     And each student can give one preference throuch which he can get updates about the subject or class timings etc.
     <br/>
     Those preferences can be through SMS or twitter/facebook or email..etc.
     <br/>
     Design above system and draw the diagram for above.
     <br/>
     Q3) coding and algorithm: There is a N-ary tree in the 3d Space. and you are standing on right side of that tree .  Print the only
     <br/>
     those nodes when you looked at that tree.
     <br/>
     ( which is like printing rightmost node in each level of that tree. He would not tell this, you have to conclude this by drawing a tree like that).
     <br/>
     After writing the code for above one, he was asked me to print them in an order in which 1st one followed be last one followed by 2nd first one followed by snd last one..etc.)
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Face to Face Round 6(some one who is in very high level, guess director to a technology):
     </strong>
     <br/>
     (After 1 week of last interview)
     <br/>
     Q1) Lots of discussion on my current project. Different behavioral  questions were asked during the discussion.( about half n hour discussion)
     <br/>
     Q2) Given a cube of size N. which was constructed by N^3 number of 1 unit smaller white cubes. Now you dipped that cube in a black color paint and taken out.
     <br/>
     after that how many cubes are still in white color. Prove your answer( by writing mathematical equations)
     <br/>
     Q3) There are N bolts each of which different size and N nuts, they are also with different sizes. and each bolt fits with exactly 1 nut.
     <br/>
     Give an algorithm that combines those N bolts and nuts into N pairs of Matched bolt and nut.
    </p><p>
     HR told me on last interview day that I would be notified by the result within two working days as already the whole process was delayed for so many days. I had waited for almost 1 week and send them mails &amp; called them about my candidature but did not get any response. I was almost lost hope. But, Finally after 8 days of last interview, got a call that  I was offered SDE1..( I guess, They were not completely satisfied by in design part but I did better in algos, problem solving and coding part and as a result I was offered SDE 1). In the end I rejected to join at Amazon as I got another competitive offer.

          For irctc design question: is it find in this way :
          <br/>
          I would have three tables Train, Station and TrainStations(which is a join of two prev tables).
          <br/>
          Train would have train id, train name etc  columns
          <br/>
          Station would have station id, station name etc columns
          <br/>
          TrainStations would have train id, station id, running day etc as columns
         </p><p>
          Now user would give :
          <br/>
          From Station
          <br/>
          To Station
          <br/>
          Date
          <br/>
          using "From station" one can fetch station id using which one can find all trains from which comes to this station on a particular day(first fetch day from date given by user)-&gt;list1
          <br/>
          Then "To station" name we can find station id of destination station
          <br/>
          then from TrainStations table we can find all trains which have "To station"-&gt;list2
          <br/>
          then intersection of list1 and list2 gives the answer.
         </p><p>
          Congrats..!!!!
          <br/>
          Can u tell us which company did u join after rejecting Amazon..must be a really tough call..
         </p><p>
          Hi Pandu, Were you required to write in a specific language? or Could you choose any language?  Could you write a pseudo-code?  Thanks!
         </p><p>
          Can you provide a little more detail about the snake and ladder problem. Does jump here consider moving your piece every time the die is flipped. Can we assume the die gets maximum value(6) every time unless it is required to get a lower value for a jump(snake bite or ladder).
         </p><p>
            Yeah, your assumption is correct.
           </p><p>
              bfs should do for for snake and ladder, is there any other approach you followed
             </p><p>
              for r3) for q2, will fixing the default poisitions of the lifts at level 1,2,4,8,16…which requires log baseN lifts would do ?
             </p><p>
              for r3) q1, didnt get the question completely its like each each URL will have images. what is the cumulative quality of images here? if url_1 has 10 images and with 2 other hyperlinked urls(url_2 and url_3) within it, and if url_2 and url_3 dont have any images.
             </p><p>
              can you please throw some on these things?
             </p><p>
              isnt they way ladder snake problem asked here, is variation of Knapsack problem
             </p><p>
                It is a dynamic programming problem. Every time you see a ladder, you will branch out, on one branch you will take the ladder, on other you will not take the ladder. Do this recursively and finally which ever branch is giving minimal moves, we consider it as answer.
               </p><p>
          Congratulations

    </p><p>
     2) He asked me to design an approach which will search all the valid combinations of a given string.
    </p><p>
     I have given some approaches like implementing TRIE, and explained the pros and cons for it and also the complexity of it.
    </p><p>
     Then i modified it and explained the Other approach which is better than the above by using HASH MAP and INDEXING with buckets if valid words.
    </p><p>
     We had lots of discussion on it. and Finally he said we are looking for guys like you.
    </p><p>
     Finally i have the offer Letter From Amazon and He asked me for Coffee Or Cold Drink. I Have taken Coffee.
    </p><p>
     NICE EXPERIENCE !! I LOVED ALL THE INTERVIEWS AND ENJOYED A LOT !!
    </p><p>

          Can someone explain what is the question k-heavy path ?
          <br/>
          What exactly do we need to find?
         </p><p>
          Can you please explain about
          <br/>
          1. calculate the area for rain drop which will be holded for bar graph
          <br/>
          2.k-heavy path approach
         </p><p>
          He asked me to design an approach which will search all the valid combinations of a given string.
         </p><p>
          Can please explain the approach of "HASH MAP and INDEXING with buckets if valid words" to solve above problem??
         </p><p>
          How much time it took to complete 1st round on-line test ?
         </p><p>
          What kind of project questions do they ask?
         </p><p>
          Please enquire amazon employees before you join, they  are better able to explain about the company and culture. I was ex amazon employee, my suggestion is dont waste your career by joining shit company like Amazon.
         </p><p>
          how to find 10 max length words from a file in decreasing order??
         </p><p>
          Questions asked are really normal and easy. Probably the interview would have been in Bangalore or Chennai location. Hyderabad Amazon really sucks.
         </p><p>
          They test mugging skills rather than problem solving,.
         </p><p>
            All Amazon centers are the same. Its like a Chemistry teacher given Bio paper to evaluate, with pre-defined Anss.
           </p><p>
            Most amazon people ask this ques: "Find the shortest path between two nodes in a tree". And they say, they love Mathematics.
           </p><p>
            Crap Maths will die.
           </p><p>
            In graph theory if you see the definition of a tree, "A tree is a connected graph with no cycles" : does mean there exists only one unique path between any two nodes.
           </p><p>

            </a>
            .
           </p><p>
            I was rejected for explaining this.
            <br/>
            I cant see Maths being killed before me.
           </p><p>
          "Finally a Gold Medalist 2yr Exp. guy who is doing a very nominal job, got a Right place to work which is AMAZON !!"
         </p><p>
          So since you got into Amazon you just couldnt resist making a trite remark in the end.
         </p><p>
          What is the profile you have applied for? Question looked pretty normal. Amazon asks more geeky question that this.
         </p><p>
          congrats Pushpendra ….

    </p><p>
     Onw online coding test followed by 4 rounds of F2F interviews.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Online Coding Test (2 Problems,20 MCQs, 1:30 hours)
     </strong>
     From Interviewstreet
     <br/>
     All problems had multiple test cases for which the code was validated against.
     <br/>
     1. from input string we have to print character which occurs maximum number of times.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Face to face: Round 1(Technical, 1 hour):
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1. Given a boolean matrix mat[M][N] of size M X N, modify it such that if a matrix cell mat[i][j] is 1 (or true) then make all the cells of ith row and jth column as 1 (time complexity expected was O(M*N) and space O(1))
     <br/>
     Solution:
     <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/a-boolean-matrix-question/" target="_blank">
      http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/a-boolean-matrix-question/
     </a>
    </p><p>
     2. Given binary tree, if we draw a line from root then we have to print all nodes on that line.
    </p><p>
     Code for both questions was required and some other discussion happened..
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Face to face: Round 2(Technical, 1 hour):
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1. Given string we have insert %20 on each space and input string has enough memory to contain output string.
     <br/>
     (time complexity expected was O(n) and space was O(1).
    </p><p>
     2.merge point of linked list.
     <br/>
     (I told I know this question so he moved ahead..)
     <br/>
     3.Given binary search tree in array form and we have to check whether it is fully binary tree or not..
     <br/>
     (I gave O(n^2) solution but He was expecting O(n) solution after some discussion I managed to give answer in O(n) complexity…)
     <br/>
     4. Given that integers are read from a data stream. We have to find k maximum elements from that stream…
     <br/>
     (I gave solution of insertion sort,then come to heap)
    </p><p>
     code for all questions required and nice discussion was there…
     <br/>
     He was very impressed with my answers…
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Face to face: Round 3(Technical, 1 hour 20 minutes):
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     -He asked me to choose topic on which questions should ask..
     <br/>
     I chose OS…
     <br/>
     -some questions on paging and virtual memory.
    </p><p>
     -If we use 8 GB RAM for 32 bit machine what will happen?
     <br/>
     It was nice question..
     <br/>
     He was very impressed with answer.
     <br/>
     -Some discussion on Networking(DHCP and DNS).
     <br/>
     -Some discussion on Linker and Loader.
     <br/>
     -Some discussion on JAVA.
     <br/>
     -Some discussion on DBMS.
    </p><p>
     -one puzzle
     <br/>
     A champagne pyramid is a pyramid made of champagne glasses , each of equal capacity say , n. The pyramid begins with one glass at the top level , two glasses at the second level , then three below that and so on up to infinite levels. A level x of the pyramid thus has x no. of champagne glasses.
    </p><p>
     A steady stream of champagne is poured down from the top level,which trickles down to the lower levels. What is the distribution of champagne in the glasses at a given level i.
     <br/>
     (I told I know this puzzle then he moved ahead..)
    </p><p>
     -Give a Building with n floor. A person can take 1 step or 2 step to climb. Find the number of ways to reach nth floor. Code was required
    </p><p>
     Interviewer was very happy after that.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Face to face: Round 4(Technical, 1 hour 20 minutes):

          Hi Mayur,
          <br/>
          Were you required to write in a specific language? or Could you choose any language?  Could you write a pseudo-code?  Thanks!
         </p><p>
            @Manjula
            <br/>
            They allow me to write code in any language..
            <br/>
            but it was proper code not pseudo code.
           </p><p>
            @amit
            <br/>
            32 bit machine can generate addresses upto limit of 4 gb only.
            <br/>
            i.e. 2^32-1 only..
            <br/>
            so remaining 4 gb memory will be unused.
           </p><p>
          please explain this question–
          <br/>
          Modified k heavy path in binary tree problem.
         </p><p>

        Amazon Interview | Set 28
       </h2><p>
     Hi, I was recently interviewed for SDE1 position for Amazon, Hyderabad but was not able to make it through. Although I wasnt selected but it was a good experience and GeeksforGeeks has been very helpful.
     <span id="more-117539">
     </span>
    </p><p>
     Following were interview questions-
     <br/>
     I had one written round and one telephonic round before 4 in-face interviews in Hyderabad.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 1 (Written):
     </strong>
     <br/>
     There were four questions which had to be submitted in a time span of two hours. Questions were:
     <br/>
     1. Given a character string, display the characters that appear more than once in that string.
     <br/>
     2. Rotate a matrix 90 degrees to right
     <br/>
     3. Convert a BST to DLL.
     <br/>
     4. Find kth largest element in a given BST.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 2 (Telephonic):
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1. First question was to get two numbers fro a BST whose sum was equal to k. I answered it using a preorder traversal to get a sorted array and than starting two index from both ends to find if two elements with sum as k exist or not. He than asked if it can be solved without using an array or extra space. I tried solving it by traversing from two ends of the tree in preoder and reverse preorder fashion and it took some time to code. Dry run of the code seemed to be right but I wasnt sure. Anyways the best way of not using extra space can be to convert tree to DLL (in space) and use the same technique as used on array.
    </p><p>
     2. For second question I was asked if I had heard the question before or not. Question was that a a matrix is given with its rows and columns sorted and an element is to be searched in that matrix. I had heard the question before but had not solved it and told the same to the interviewer. After thinking for a while I could get an algo by starting at the rightmost element of the first row. If element if bigger we move down or else we move right. The solution was fine but he doubted that I had solved it earlier.
    </p><p>
     3. He asked to write a program of finding the square root of a number without using library functions. I had done it before and told him the same. I used Newton-rapson method to get the solution but he wanted it through something on the lines of binary search. I almost got the solution but may be I was running out of time so he dropped the question there only and asked me to dictate the solution of 2nd problem.
    </p><p>
     Two days later I got a call that I have cleared my telephonic round and have to be present in Hyderabad for further rounds(four). Arrangements done my Amazon and I appeared for the further rounds on 27/4/2013 in their Hyderabad office.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Onsite:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Round 1 (Technical):
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1. First question was to find the vertical sum of a binary tree. I told him the solution using and array/hash. Whenever we move left we decremented the index while moving right we increment the index. The solution looked fine to him but he wasnt very comfortable with negative indexing. So he asked for another solution using doubly linked list. Initially I wasnt getting it but when he gave some hint I was bale to solve it but it took some time to cover edge cases. With the final solution he looked convinced.
    </p><p>
     2. Next question was to have Stack operations of Push, Pop, and FindMax in O(1) time. I started doing this using only one index of max variable but than I realised I needed max index at all levels so gave him a solution using two stacks. One having the element and the other having the corresponding max index. He looked convinced with the solution.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 2 (Technical):
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1. In second round there were two interviewers and coincidentally one of them was the same guy who took my telephonic interview. First question was related on how to chose the ‘related items list whenever a product is displayed on Amazon website. the problem was to find the least related product for a given product. Initially I answered using n-ary tree but told him that we would have duplicate entries. He asked for optimized solution so I suggested using adjancy-list nut finally realized that it can be solved using graphs. They were convinced and asked to code. I solved it using a Queue so while traversing a matrix we pushed in the elements in the queue with their level of relation. They were convinced with the solution.
    </p><p>
     2. Second question was to delete an element from doubly linked list. I solved it but missed out on and edge case where the element to be deleted is not present in the list. I added that check later.
    </p><p>
     3. Third was that for a given BST invert the signs of the elements and finally have a new BST. It clicked my mind that after sign inversion it will be a mirror tree and gave the solution for the same.
     <br/>
     Till this time feedback looked fine.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 3 (Technical-Managerial):
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1. The next interviewer was senior guy and asked me about my work. Explained him in detail.
    </p><p>
     2. Later he asked me that for a given binary tree having three address fields i.e. left, right and bfs successor, left and right fields are filled and the successor field is to be filled. I solved it using level order traversal with a queue but he wanted solution without using extra space. I was taking time to solve it when he gave hint about keeping track of the parent. After this hint I was able to solve it with few conditions missing but with his intervention I was able to give a working code (as looked to him and me).
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 4 (Technical-Managerial):
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1. There were two interviewers. First question was tell me about yourself and your work.
    </p><p>
     2. Given a m*n matrix, we need to find the number of ways by which a bot can reach the (m-1,n-1) block if bot can move only right and down while starting from (0,0). I gave him a solution using DP. Build the recursion tree showing the final solution. He didnt ask to code but asked to finds the recurrence relation. I got stuck I dont know why. I guess this was the start of decline. he gave some hints and I was finally able to write it, still.
    </p><p>
     3. For a given binary tree and a key, prune the tree with all the paths (root to leaf) that have sum less than or equal to k. I was able to solve it with some hint. The solution looked convincing.
    </p><p>
     Four days later I got a mail stating that "
     <em>
      Unfortunately, we are unable to take your candidature further, at the moment. However, your credentials are extremely impressive and we wish to retain your details on our active database. We shall get back to you as soon as another similar opportunity opens up

          Hey great info,
          <br/>
          But i just wanted to know whether  online(written) test did it consist only coding question or there were some other questions as well e.g. MCQ ?
         </p><p>
          Which topics did they encompass?
         </p><p>
          How many questions and time ??
         </p><p>
          Thanks a lot.
         </p><p>
            There were only four programming questions that I have already mentioned. There were no MCQs or anything else.
            <br/>
            The four questions were to be submitted in 2 hours.

             </p><p>
              how to chose the ‘related items list whenever a product is displayed on Amazon website. the problem was to find the least related product for a given product,etc….
             </p><p>
              Can you explain it with some example?

                Whenever an item is selected for buying, a list of items is displayed below it under the title ‘related items. There was a need of algorithm to select the items to be displayed.
               </p><p>
          Can you elaborate the last question?
         </p><p>
            A path is from root to leaf and every path will have some sum calculated by the values of the nodes on this path. So if the sum of nodes on that path is less than or equal to ‘k than that path needs to be removed. E.g. If there are two leaves of a node and one has sum less than k then only that leaf will be deleted while if both are less then all three nodes will be deleted.

        Amazon Interview | Set 27
       </h2><p>
     Hi, I was recently interviewed for SDE1 position for Amazon and got selected. I have 1.5 year experience in java.  Geeksforgeeks helped me lot. I am very thankful to Geeksforgeeks team.
     <span id="more-117110">
     </span>
     Following were interview questions-
    </p><p>
     Two telephonic rounds followed by 5 F2F interviews.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 1 (Telephonic):
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     1.     There is a dictionary already implemented. Write a method, which takes input String without space, to prints all subsets of the input string which is present in dictionary.
    </p><p>
     Example: Dictionary – a*
     <br/>
     ………….Input- aaabaa
     <br/>
     ………….Output- a,a,a,aa,aa,aaa,a,a,aa
    </p><p>
     2.     There is a dictionary already implemented. Write a method , which takes input String without space, to replace the characters from the strings which are not present in dictionary with –
    </p><p>
     Example: Dictionary – a*
     <br/>
     ………….Input- aaabaa
     <br/>
     ………….Output- aaa_aa
    </p><p>
     Interviewer was cool. Did not code properly (lots of bugs were in code), but gave good approach for first question. For second question solution sent in a mail.

          @Neha,

          Congrates
          <img alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" src="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif"/>
          Can you please provide sudo code for below question.
         </p><p>
          Write a program to calculate a^b and store it in floating point representation.
         </p><p>
          @Neha
          <br/>
          For the Question Write a program to remove duplicates from array of prime numbers.
         </p><p>
          Is there any use of prime numbers here,we can remove duplicates from the array in O(n) time and O(n) space(hash),is there an better solution or to say some thing that can be used here for prime number info.
         </p><p>
            Yes. I gave the solution using prime number property- Prime number is divisible by 1 or it self.
           </p><p>
              one mistake in previous comment
             </p><p>
                Ok thats simple thinking!!
               </p><p>
                The approach is good but if the n increases more than 30+ then its not going to work as the result will be more than the range of int64. I personally believe that hash or map is the best answer for this question. (No offence
                <img alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" src="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif"/>
                )
               </p><p>
          r4) questions 3
          <br/>
          FOR, Write a code to find top hundred elements in a data set which cannot be loaded in RAM.
         </p><p>
          assuming top means highly occurring, using hash with heap may no t be appropriate as hash may not fit into ram, using B or B+
          <br/>
          with heap is expected answer ?
         </p><p>
            I gave solution of o(kn). where n is the number of elements in data set and k is number of top elements. In this question k=100.
            <br/>
            Approach- Create a linked list (list) whose size cannot be more than 100 and all elements of list is in sorted ascending order. This list is used to store top k elements.
            <br/>
            For each element a[i] of date set perform following steps-
            <br/>
            if (Size of listlist(first))
            <br/>
            {
            <br/>
            remove first element from list and put a[i] at appropriate position in list.
            <br/>
            }else
            <br/>
            {
            <br/>
            // do nothing
            <br/>
            }
            <br/>
            }
           </p><p>
            He was happy with approach and asked me to write code.
           </p><p>
              This can be solved using K-way merge
             </p><p>
              what does top mean here? , k largest elements ?
             </p><p>
              In your code, what does "Size of listlist(first): do?
             </p><p>
                yes its k largest element.
                <br/>
                Some lines from my previous comment has been removed.. I had written something like-
                <br/>
                For each element a[i] of date set perform following steps-
               </p><p>

                <br/>

                <br/>
                }else

                  <br/>
                  else do following steps if(a[i]&gt;list(first))

     Given an array containing both positive and negative elements, arrange in such a manner — 1 positive number, then 1 negative,then 1 positive and so on. If number of negative numbers are more,extra numbers should be kept in end and vice versa. Note the order of negative and positive elements should be same in the modified array and you are not allowed to use any extra space

     no technical questions at all
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 4
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     After some personal questions, the interviewer asked some technical questions as well
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      1.
     </strong>
     Suppose we receive requests for a page, but we want to ensure that max no of request per sec is ‘x. If there are more than x requests,what will you do?
     <br/>
     We want a continuous flow. How will you do that?
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      2.
     </strong>
     Suppose in a system, some processes are already running. Now when an user will give new task(or process), he will give a list of processes his process is dependent upon. Some of those may be running, some may not be running right now. You have to ensure that there is no contention, i.e., If a process, Pj is dependent on process Pi,
     <br/>
     Pj should not execute along with Pi. How will you ensure that? Complete algorithm with code was required. The interviewer went on complicating the problem.
     <br/>
     At last I used graph and 3 hashmaps to solve the problem. He was ok with it.
    </p><p>
     Thats it. My last round completed and I was selected.

          Hi Amit,
         </p><p>
          Congrats
          <img alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" src="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif"/>
          Can you please post the full solution for round 4 question 1 &amp; 2 which you wrote there?
         </p><p>
            He has already answered the question. He proposed leaky bucket algorithm, which will maintain the rate, and will drop the overflowed request.
           </p><p>
            Moreover, queue will not do any good, in the sense that, we would service them later if the rate is continuously greater than x.
           </p><p>
            If the rate is always greater than x we can either put it in queue buffer and finally let it overflow or just drop the request.
           </p><p>
              what about the second question den?
             </p><p>
                thanx harini..i gave a solution for ques 2..please see the comments below
               </p><p>
          any insights on round 4 question 2 ?
         </p><p>
            I used an undirected graph. Suppose a process Pi is dependent on k other processes,then there will be an edge between Pi and each of those k processes. So when Pi gets the CPU from ready queue based on some scheduling algorithm, it will first check whether anyone of those k process are already running. If yes, it will go to wait,else it will continue. This is the basic gist of what I said.I was asked to implement 2 functions,one when a process wants a CPU,what should it do? and 2nd when a process terminates,what should it do(waking up the waiting processes,if dependent only on it)…try for this. If you still want the complete code which i wrote there,do tell me

          Place +ve and -ve alternately.
          <br/>
          This is available on geeksforgeeks.The normal approach is to bring all -ve at front and then find first +ve and then do the required processing.
          <br/>
          But how can we do it by maintaining the order of the +ve and -ve same in0(n).The approach that i know will change the relative order.Please tell ur approach.
         </p><p>
            I did it in o(n^2). As it was coding round and 3/4 test cases passed for this ques and all test cases for remaining questions,it dint matter if my solution was not optimal.
           </p><p>
          What was your approach for round 4 question 2
         </p><p>
          another way of solving round 4 question 3 : it can also be done using tournament sort.
         </p><p>
            there were only 2 ques in round 4.. ques 3???
           </p><p>
              i meant question 2.
             </p><p>
          for round 4 , question 1 : did you suggest using queue i.e if number of request exceeds ‘x then add it to a queue..
         </p><p>
          for round 1 , question 2 : it can be done using queue , how did you do inplace??
         </p><p>
            Inplace doesnt mean that we cant use extra space…Inplace means u cant create new nodes and swap data…I used 2 stacks.
           </p><p>
              Did you try doing without using a stack? You can figure it out once you have done with two stacks. I will post the solution
             </p><p>
              Amit, you can do it without using any stack too, we can take advantage of the prev pointers of each node.
             </p><p>
                Yesss,,may be i forgot that time..But the interviewer accepted the code at first go,so i dint think too much..Thanx for suggesting this solution
               </p><p>
                Yesss,,may be i forgot that time..But the interviewer accepted the approach using 2 stacks at first go,so i dint think too much..Thanx for suggesting this solution
               </p><p>
            round 4,ques1–I dont know the correct answer for this question till now. One of my class-mates gave the leaky bucket algorithm  and token bucket algorithm for congestion control. the interviewer accepted. But when i said the same, he refused and asked for something else(as it was already given). I gave several approaches, but I personally dont think there is any better solution then those algorithms

        Amazon Interview | Set 33
       </h2><p>
     I recently attended a walk-in for Software development Engineer (SDE- 1) at Amazon, Bangalore.
     <span id="more-119437">
     </span>
    </p><p>
     Here is my experience of Amazon interview.
    </p><p>
     As I was from the same city, there was no phone interview.  I have listed down all questions that I remember.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 1: Data Structures, Algorithms and coding (1 hour)
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     Interviewer just started off with questions without introduction and stuff.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      1)
     </strong>
     Given a singly linked list, swap every 2 nodes, for odd number of input; retain the last node as it is.
     <br/>
     Eg: Input:  5 13 15 18 20 11 6 7
     <br/>
     Output: 13 5 18 15 11 20 7 6
     <br/>
     I was asked to write the code straight-away.
     <br/>
     Wrote the same, verified boundary cases and discussed.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      2)
     </strong>
     Given a binary tree, find the number of pairs where sum of 2 nodes values equal to k
     <br/>
     Eg:
    </p><p>
     Say k=7, output =2 ( 2+5, 3+4)
     <br/>
     Suggested an approach where Id use inorder traversal of this,
     <br/>
     Then interviewer asked me to solve the simplified problem, find k in sorted array instead of tree.
     <br/>
     Got solution for this one, to have 2 pointers at each end, and traverse accordingly.
     <br/>
     I was asked the approach for extending same to BST.
     <br/>
     Then, I implemented the same for BST using stack.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 2: Data Structures, Algorithms and coding (1 hour)
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      1)
     </strong>
     Given input as k sorted arrays, generate a single sorted list as output.
     <br/>
     Eg:
     <br/>
     Array1: 1 5 8 9 11 ….
     <br/>
     Array2: 2 12 24 44 …..
     <br/>
     .
     <br/>
     .
     <br/>
     Arrayk: 3 15 79 115 ….
     <br/>
     Output: Array1: 1 2 3 5 8 9 11 12 15 ….
     <br/>
     Discussed the approach, and complexity, then wrote the code for the same.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      2)
     </strong>
     Given a function isGreater, compare user defined objects and then return the object that is greater than all other objects.
     <br/>
     Twist: obj1 &gt; obj2 and obj2 &gt; obj3 does not mean obj1&gt;obj3
     <br/>
     I asked for the use case for the same, as I was not convinced with the problem.
     <br/>
     He gave an example of games/ 1 team winning another.
     <br/>
     Discussed the approach and then wrote the code.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      3)
     </strong>
     Given an input sentence, output the non repeated words in the sentence.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      4)
     </strong>
     How are maps implemented?
    </p><p>
     Interviewer then clarified my questions about Amazon.
    </p><p>
     Both first and second rounds were at similar difficulty level.
    </p><p>
     If the interview feedback was bad for any of these, the candidate was eliminated. If at least 1 of these went well and other "not sure", then too candidate is called for next rounds.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 3: Hiring Manager round (1 hour 40 minutes)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Discussed on my current roles and responsibilities
    </p><p>
     why do you want to join to Amazon?
    </p><p>
     What are your accomplishments in your role so far?
    </p><p>
     What are the things that youre not good at and need to improve?
    </p><p>
     Serialization of Binary tree. Given 1 traversal is it possible to re-construct the binary tree.
    </p><p>
     Write code to reconstruct the tree given any 2 traversals.
     <br/>
     I took in-order and post-order traversal, discussed the approach and wrote recursive solution.
     <br/>
     Was then asked the approach for iterative.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 4: Culture Fit Round
     </strong>
     <br/>
     This surprisingly had a data structure question first.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      1)
     </strong>
     Given a n (large number) lists of customers who visited n webpages on n (large number) days, design a data structure to get customers who have visited the website on exactly "k" days and should have visited at least "m" distinct pages altogether.
     <br/>
     Was then asked to improvise the solution as much as possible
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      2)
     </strong>
     Details on my previous project and job profile
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      3)
     </strong>
     Challenging situation faced
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      4)
     </strong>
     Why should we hire you?
    </p><p>
     Then, he answered some of my questions.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 5: Coding, Algorithm and data structures (Technical round with a senior developer)
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     Started with questions straight away
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      1)
     </strong>
     Least common ancestor of a binary tree  (Solution and Code)
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      2)
     </strong>
     Given a 2 dimensional array sorted vertically and horizontally, search for an element and return true if the element is present. (Algorithm, Code and Complexity)
    </p><p>
     Example
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      3)
     </strong>
     Something on count sort.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      4)
     </strong>
     Print binary tree in zig-zag order..
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      5)
     </strong>
     Gold box problem (Approach)
    </p><p>
     There are ‘n gold boxes placed in a row, each having different number of gold coins.
    </p><p>
     2 players play a game, where the motive is to collect the maximum number of gold coins. Each player can see how many coins are present in each box, but can get a box from either end only, on his turn.
    </p><p>
     Design a strategy such that Player1 wins (Assuming both players play smartly)
    </p><p>
     I got the hiring call after couple of days, after my last round of interview.  They said feedback was very positive and theyre happy to hire me.
    </p><p>
     Was so happy

<h2>
        Amazon Interview | Set 24
       </h2><p>
     Hello Guys, I had 6 rounds(written + telephonic+ 4f2f interviews) in hyderabad centre of Amazon.
     <span id="more-116779">
     </span>
    </p><p>
     I was 90% sure that I would clear the interview but I got rejected. The only reason I felt I was rejected was that the interview process was immature. The interviewer interviewing was a guy with 1yr of work ex expecting solution in the manner he wanted, which was pretty unexpected from a technology giant like amazon.
    </p><p>
     Every round of Amazon would have basic question like what you do etc. But all that is just formality, it doesnt count since one interviewer stopped me in between and said we have less time lets talk about problem solving(Which was again not expected from technology giant)
    </p><p>
     Also, for those writing written this month, the written round would have the same questions as I have listed below. So please solve this, before going for written
    </p><p>
     Anyways, these were my questions:
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Written(Interview street) – 3 Questions:
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     a) General code for coin denomination problem where the input was an array containing the coin denomination and the sum we want.
    </p><p>
     b) Rectangle overlap problem(Can be found in geeksforgeeks)
    </p><p>
     c) String Matching Problem(Wrote KMP)
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Telephonic Interview:
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     a) Convert BST in place into doubly linked list
    </p><p>
     b) Given a Binary Tree is it a BST
    </p><p>
     If you miss one edge case, you are out of the interview. This is what they check and nothing else. They dont check your logic, they only see  if you write proper code. So always start with brute force and write proper code.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      F2f interview(1st round) – Very easy
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     a) Given a number is it divisible by 3 and 5
    </p><p>
     – Only catch here were the edge cases and nothing else
    </p><p>
     b) angle between hour hand and minute hand
    </p><p>
     c) Revere bits in a binary
    </p><p>
     d) Get the kth node from end of linked list
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      F2f inteview(round2)
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     a) It was basically on writing multi-threading code(Write multi-threaded code for Enqueue of Queue using linked list)
    </p><p>
     b) Asked about basic complexities in Queue, hash and tree
    </p><p>
     c) Window Problem(In an array, find the minimum of the set in a given window). There are many solutions using hash, brute force. But the dequeue answer is what he was expecting.
    </p><p>
     I gave the deque answer
    </p><p>
     Any other answer to this problem was a reject
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      F2F Interview(Round -3)

     a) Given a doubly linked linked, delete the occurrences of duplicate element from it. ( One miss of edge case and out again)
    </p><p>
     (for eg) If you write,  temp-&gt;prev-&gt;next = temp-&gt;next without actually adding the condition,    if(temp-&gt;prev) then temp-&gt;prev-&gt;next = temp-&gt;next
    </p><p>
     b) Given a matrix with ordered rows and columns(Rows are sorted 0s followed by 1s). Find the row with maximum 0?s(linear time)
    </p><p>
     I answered it
    </p><p>
     c) DataStructure with Insert O(1), Deletion O(1) Search O(1) and ReturnAnyElement O(1)
    </p><p>
     Again answered this using augment of hash and doubly linked list
    </p><p>
     d) Given a tree with negative and positive numbers, return the root with maximum sum in its sub-tree
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      F2f interview(round-4)
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     a) It was basically a design interview where I was told to some OOPS design
    </p><p>
     b) Given a stream of 0s and 1s(You Tube). Find the first occurrence of 1 in it. Then the question was changed to a string instead of a stream.
    </p><p>
     Finally, after giving 100% it was reject. So according to my experience, if you dont give 100% you are out or else it is ur luck that you get through amazons process.
    </p><p>
     Moreover, currently they have started exploring candidates by sending two interviewers which actually means that the one is new to interviewing and other is experienced. Hence, basically they are playing with interviewers.

     If you want the answers for questions, please comment I will post it.

          Same thing happened to me. I was also rejected with multiple interviews and still no feedback as to why I was rejected.
         </p><p>
            dont worry.
            <br/>
            I appeared for an amazon interview recently (and reluctantly).
            <br/>
            I cleared all the rounds and was asked to appear for the bar raiser.
           </p><p>
            It seems that they expect the interview candidate to come up with the solutions on the spot. (given that most of their questions are repeated and can be found anywhere). If you have come without preparation and are making up the solution then and there, you will mostly not make it.
           </p><p>
            I was impressed with the initial rounds but after the bar-raiser, it is unlikely that i will appear for an interview again.
           </p><p>
          Hey great info,
          <br/>
          But i just wanted to know whether  online(written) test did it consist only coding question or there were some other questions as well e.g. MCQ ?
         </p><p>
          Which topics did they encompass?
         </p><p>
          How many questions and time ??
         </p><p>
          Thanks a lot.
         </p><p>
          Hello.
         </p><p>
          It is inspiring to read all of your interview experiences here and geeksforgeeks is really awesome.
          <br/>
          I am just beginning to prepare for Amazon. I know they give you code stubs in the written part. I was wondering if someone could post just the skeleton. The reason I ask is: It will help someone with no experience like me, get a glimpse of the code they actually provide and give me practice in writing on top of it.
         </p><p>
          Thanks
         </p><p>
            Just attempt a sample test on interview street and you will have answers to the questions u asked. By interview street I mean the URL
            <a href="http://www.interviewstreet.com" rel="nofollow">
             http://www.interviewstreet.com
            </a>
            . Amazon no way checks the analysis of the report they generate so concentrate on writing code(whether it is brute force or optimised it doesnt matter )Written test is generally simple but there would be one question which would be out of box. So be prepared for that
           </p><p>
          Yes, you are right..immature interview process.. i crossed 4 levels, they said they ll inform me abt the next interview soon.. but they mailed me dat i was rejected !
          <br/>
          dont get upset, if u had the same..they dont knw what they want !
         </p><p>
          Please share Design problems what they asked?
         </p><p>
          I didnt understand few of your questions.
          <br/>
          Can you please explain them in more details-
          <br/>
          In F2F Round 2 Question c- Are you referring to finding the minimum in the set of numbers.
          <br/>
          In F2F Round 3 Question c- why do we need both doubly linked list and a hash.
          <br/>
          In F2F Round 4 Question a- Please share the design problem
          <br/>
          In F2F Round 4 Question b- Does changing stream to string made any diff to the solution
         </p><p>
          Do we need to clear all questions of online test to expect telephonic call?
         </p><p>
            I guess the written round is just a formality. The main round is the telephonic round if u stay outside bangalore or hyderabad because they pay for the tickets for the in-house interview. But I solved all the questions of the written round. So I cannot be sure.
           </p><p>
          Please post the answers for
          <br/>
          2 a), c)
          <br/>
          3 b), d)
         </p><p>
          Yes u r right,they are not really interested in ur logic and focus mainly on edge cases.
          <br/>
          I also went through 4 rounds and the interviewer also seemed satisfied with my logic and said that they will inform me for the next round.But the very next day I got the rejection mail.
          <br/>
          There couldnt be any worse experience than this.
         </p><p>
          solution of 3.c please !!!
         </p><p>
          Given a stream of 0?s and 1?s(You Tube). Find the first occurrence of 1 in it. Then the question was changed to a string instead of a stream. Plz answer to this
         </p><p>
            In case of stream, look at 2 to the power of k , and break at the first occurrence of 1 . In case of string, apply binary search last occurrence of 1
           </p><p>
              Question is still not clear to me.
              <br/>
              so we have a stream like {0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,..}.
              <br/>
              or we can say a sorted stream of 0 and 1.
              <br/>
              in case of stream we dont know length of the stream so we started from pow(2,0) after that pow(2,1)…… and when we find first occurrence
              <br/>
              1 we will do binary search between pow(2,i-1) and pow(2,i).
             </p><p>
              and for string do binary search and find the first occurrence of 1
             </p><p>
          F2F round 3-b)–meaning of "ordered rows and columns""
         </p><p>
          The same thing happened to me
          <br/>
          I was also rejecting even after answering all the questions in every round.
          <br/>
          Probably they were expecting standard answers or I would say the bookish code.
         </p><p>
          Would like to know more details about how much time is given for each question on interview street.
         </p><p>
            1 hour for 3 questions
           </p><p>
          Man,
         </p><p>
          amazons interview process is like that. If you have the answer for every question in your memory then they will take you and this happens only in India.
         </p><p>
            You mean they wont take you, or will take you?
           </p><p>
              they want solution muggers not problem solvers !!
              <br/>
              also their interviewers are immature .
             </p><p>
                Amazon sucks…. They just want Muggers … Before 2 years it used to be good people taking good interviews . Now these Muggers are taking Interviews and they respect only Muggers . These "Newton" thinks that People can solve problems which are research papers on the fly . For eg. It is good to know O(n) solution of Histogram Area (with stack) but do you really expect someone who has not seen the solution can come up with it in 40mins ?
               </p><p>
                  Hey dude !! Just chill out, leave amazon their work actually sucks. I have many friends working there. Moreover, its not a stable life there. All my interviewers had a work ex of 6 months to 2 years in amazon, which actually shows the immatureness of the company. So just leave amazon, even if u have went through all the rounds, one can easily get through ms. Anyways, I had a nice experience

          Hi Muthukumar:
          <br/>
          Congratulations! All the best!.
         </p><p>
          Could you please tell me how you prepared and how long your preparation was. It will help me perfect my preparation process. Hoping you might answer.
         </p><p>
          Thanks
         </p><p>
          @Sreenivas,
         </p><p>
          Thanks for suggesting better approach!
         </p><p>
          Heres an implementation as per your suggestion:
         </p><p>
          By the way, how did you solve it using Heap Sort in O(m*n*log n) time? Can you specify that logic?
         </p><p>
            With reference to the sorted print of elements of matrix,
            <br/>
            Heapsort the matrix at each column level.I want to say that treat an column as an array.heapsort that array..
            <br/>
            complexity is o(mnlogm) with 0(1) extra space
            <br/>
            and then print the array rowwise
           </p><p>
            #include&lt;stdio.h&gt;
            <br/>
            #include&lt;iostream&gt;
            <br/>
            #include&lt;stdlib.h&gt;
           </p><p>
            #define M 5
            <br/>
            #define N 4
           </p><p>
            void swap(int heap[][N],int index1,int index2,int col)  {
            <br/>
            int temp=heap[index1][col];
            <br/>
            heap[index1][col]=heap[index2][col];
            <br/>
            heap[index2][col]=temp;
            <br/>
            return;
            <br/>

          For printing the (m x n) matrix elements in the sorted order, you could have used m-way merge sort, which would take O(m * n * log n) time.
         </p><p>
            @Hitesh,
           </p><p>
            You can solve this in O(n) time if linked list is not read-only.
           </p><p>
            Hint:
            <br/>
            1. Find the middle of the list
            <br/>
            2. Reverse the linked list from middle to end
            <br/>
            3. Have 2 pointers one starts at head and other starts at mid
            <br/>
            4. start comparing both the pointers by traversing the list
            <br/>
            5. Reverse the list again from the middle to end to retain the original list
            <br/>
            Note: Take care of odd/even size of the list.
           </p><p>

     Test was on Interview Street Platform.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Qs-1)
     </strong>
     A function printMostFrequentWords, which takes in an array of strings, was given. It is required to print a list of all the letters that occurred with the highest frequency in each line of the array, followed by the frequency.
     <br/>
     The list of letters should be an alphabetical list of upper case letters followed by an alphabetical list of lower case letters.
    </p><p>
     Sample Test Cases:
    </p><p>
     Input #00:

     Third case was a bit tricky.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Qs-4)
     </strong>
     Rotate an M*N matrix by 90 degrees. There was no function given in this case. Everything should be assumed by you only.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Qs-5)
     </strong>
     Delete the Kth Node from a linked list.
    </p><p>
     I solved 4 questions with all test cases while for another 1 only 10/15 test cases passed.

     Spiral level order traversal of a tree. (Use two stacks)
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Qs-2)
     </strong>
     A person can jump 1 or 2 steps. No of ways of reaching the top of n stairs. (Try for O(1) space.)
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Qs-3)
     </strong>
     Find the longest substring in a string with exactly 2 unique characters. The substring should not contain more than two different chars.
    </p><p>
     So, aaaaabbaaa is a valid substring

     I answered all the 3 questions and was confident of receiving the call for onsite which I did.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      F2F ROUND 1:
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Qs-1)
     </strong>
     The question was to print a tree vertically. Please note it was not asked to get the sum at each vertical level. We have to print nodes at various vertical levels starting from the leftmost vertical level to the rightmost vertical level.
    </p><p>
     I suggested array of vector then a hashing. Finally I gave a solution based on DLL.
    </p><p>
     Code was written using DLL only.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Qs-2 )
     </strong>
     Only approach was asked on how will you save a binary tree in a file( Not a BST)
    </p><p>
     There are no assumptions on Binary tree.
    </p><p>
     This round went well for me.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      F2F ROUND 2:
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Qs-1)
     </strong>
     First I was asked to design a Data structure with O(1) insertion and O(1) search. I told about hashing. Then he told me to get a random number from the current list of numbers which have been inserted into my Ds. So I maintained an array storing pointers to the hash table.(Assume no Collision, he told so).Then he said O(1) deletion also. I was stuck on this I was not able to make both deletion and getRandom in O(1).After Some Discussion he moved on.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Qs-2)
     </strong>
     He told there is a range, defined by a min val and a max val. In a given array I had to find all elements within the range. I told him its only possible in O(n).We have to look at each element. Then he told me to assume array as sorted. Then I used Binary search for finding indexes of ceil of min and floor of max to find the elements in the range.
    </p><p>
     This round went ok for me.2nd question i wrote proper code with all edge cases, but in first I got stuck a bit.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      F2F ROUND 3:
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Qs-1)
     </strong>
     In a binary tree, a complete path is defined as a path from root to a leaf. The sum of all nodes on that path is defined as the sum of that path. Given a number K, we have to remove (prune the tree) nodes from the tree which lie on a path having sum less than K.
    </p><p>
     Note: A node can be part of multiple paths. So we have to delete it only in case when all paths from it have sum less than K.
    </p><p>
     I was able to solve the problem and write correct working code for this.
     <br/>
     (Hint : Think of a bottom up approach.)
     <br/>
     Note: Values in tree can be -ve also.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Qs-2)
     </strong>
     A robot problem: No. of ways to reach from 0,0 to m,n in a m*n grid. I had to tell recursive function only. No code required.
    </p><p>
     This round went very good for me. The first question was a bit tricky but solving it raised my confidence.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      F2F Round 4 with Hiring Manager:
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Qs-1)
     </strong>
     This was mostly a HR Based round. A lot of questions about my previous work, my initiatives, challenges I faced and many other questions.
    </p><p>
     A simple question on matrix was also there. Fill rows and cols with ones if a 1 is present in that row or a col. Code also required.
    </p><p>
     Question based on shipment and orders etc. Eg: What all things to take care in b/w of order placed and item shipped. What all factors and things you will consider.
     <br/>
     I was being interviewed for transportation team. So questions based on it.
    </p><p>
     Overall, the round went well
    </p><p>
     I returned to Bangalore that night.
     <br/>
     Few days later, I got a call from HR saying I am very close and I need to appear for another round in Bangalore office.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      F2f Round 5:
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     About half an hour Hr based discussion.
     <br/>
     Then two Technical questions with code:
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Qs-1)
     </strong>
     In a binary tree, return true if all leaves are at same level and return false if all leaves are not at the same level.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Qs-2)
     </strong>
     An array is given which is first increasing and then decreasing. Find the pivot element. Need to take care of all the edge cases.
    </p><p>
     This round went well for me. Mostly this round was on soft skills. I did well in coding questions and wrote proper code for both.
    </p><p>
     In the evening I got a call from HR that I was selected.

    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Interview Round 1(75 Minutes):
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Technical Interview
     <br/>
     Asked to  give a brief idea about my project.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Question 1:
     </strong>
     Given a linked list,reverse every k nodes of  the linked list.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Question 2:
     </strong>
     given a matrix of size  m * n, place k students in such a way so that cheating in an exam could be minimized…. Was asked  to just explain the approach, no code required.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Question 3:
     </strong>
     suppose a online chat between customer and serviceman, serviceman wants to reply to customer as soon as possible…suppose text which is to be sent as reply takes 10 sec for being typed. How can he make typing faster ?
     <br/>
     My answer was using autoprediction feature, by which he will need to type less number of characters, so typing will become faster..
     <br/>
     Then question was extended to how to store the words for being used in prediction…
     <br/>
     I answered a trie data structure which allows prefix matching..
     <br/>
     Then question was further extended to write a code to  traverse all the words stored in dictionary in lexicographic order..
    </p><p>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Interview Round 2(50-60 Minutes):
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Technical Interview
     <br/>
     First of all was asked to tell something about myself.
     <br/>
     Then a detailed discussion about the project, conversation continued nearly for 20 minutes, he wanted me to explain him everything from the scratch.. I used genetic algorithm in my project..so he  wanted to explain him the concept of genetic algorithm..
     <br/>
     Then a coding question:: stable stock problem.
     <br/>
     You are given prices of stock of a company at  consecutive days in an array..write a code to find the maximum profit one can make by keeping a stock value for as long as possible..that value of a stock is called a stable stock value.
     <br/>
     Example::
     <br/>
     6 5 9 8 3
     <br/>
     So maximum profit is 15, because stock of value 5 would be hold  for  3 days. So max profit is 15.
     <br/>
     The problem basically was a variation of  finding  index of next smaller element.
     <br/>
     I solved it using the concept of largest rectangular area in a histogram where need to keep track of previous  smaller will not be required.
    </p><p>

     <strong>
      Interview Round 3(60-75 Minutes): (Bar Raiser Round)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Technical Interview
     <br/>
     Interviewer was very cool.. he first asked about me, did some casual talk to do away with my nervousness.
     <br/>
     Infact, he told me that  it looks like that you all have studied geeks for geeks very thoroughly so I am going to ask you a question that is not present in geeks for geeks. He challenged me it will be a question you have not heard of  before.  At  the end of round, he showed me it was a question from top coder, but I had never heard of anything called top coder before.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Question 1:
     </strong>
     Given a string, find the longest sinusoidal sequence in it. If there are multiple such sequences of same maximum length, return the one which comes first in lexicographic order in a dictionary..
     <br/>
     Sinusoidal means increasing then decreasing then increasing and so on.
     <br/>
     Example ::
     <br/>
     a r u n ::
     <br/>
     a  u n , a r n , r u n are three such sequences of length 3…. But,  a r n is output  since it comes first in lexicographic order.
     <br/>
     Interviewer gave me hints that if I had to found the  sequence in which all elements were increasing, then I answered LIS will give me the solution , this was the hint. So, basically, it was a variation of LIS. I answered it in O(n2) and  2n space….
     <br/>
     Then was asked to do it in (n) space and o(n).
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Question 2:
     </strong>
     Suppose a student needs to implement a bst structure to solve a problem, but instead he used a linked list…. Then give an example of input sequence, in which his implementation works… new value will always be added at beginning of a linked list.. so. Basically at each step after insertion , root of  bst and head of link list should point to same node. I was asked to provide the sequence.

      Interview Round 4( 35 Minutes)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     This  round  started  of  with some nontechnical  questions.. what will I do in different situations?
     <br/>
     They seemed to have found out every detail of terms involved in my project..so, there was a detailed discussion on project… my project involved concepts of statistics, so he asked me questions regarding stats…. This discussion went nearly for half an hour…. In the end, he told me lets see whether your project could bring you to amazon….
     <br/>
     After the 4th round, I nearly have to wait for 4 hours before the result were announced. Finally, the interviewer said they were highly impressed by me and I was hired.
     <br/>
     In total 7 students were selected among us.
     <br/>

          Interview round 1, question 1: what type of linked list (SLL, DLL) was given?
         </p><p>
          For round 3 Q1, As hinted by arun, i have coded modified LIS to get the max possible sine string.
          <br/>
          It is O(N^2) and O(2N) for me too.
         </p><p>
          max_high: 0 max_low: 1  ‘a
          <br/>
          max_high: 2 max_low: 1  ‘r
          <br/>
          max_high: 2 max_low: 1  ‘u
          <br/>
          max_high: 2 max_low: 3  ‘n
          <br/>
          I get a two dimensional array, can you give ideas on how to reconstruct??
          <br/>
          I can get all possible string. That would require additional space. How did you do it in O(2N)?

          Round 3 ,question 1
         </p><p>
          Sequence can be broken down into first increasing/decresing,then decreasing/increasing,then increasing.decreasing…
          <br/>
          Hence the output will be number of such total Divisions of given sequence .

          Heres the code in O(n) time .
         </p><p>
          It can be pretty easily modified to print the original sequence ,using o(n) space .

            Please dont use above code.Didnt read the problem specification clearly.above code also considers equal elements .

                Thnx
               </p><p>
          there is a similar question in array tags…simple check of same element needs to be included
         </p><p>
            @Arun
            <br/>
            Place +ve and -ve alternately.
            <br/>
            This is available on geeksforgeeks.The normal approach is to bring all -ve at front and then find first +ve and then do the required processing.
            <br/>
            But how can we do it by maintaining the order of the +ve and -ve same in0(n).The approach that i know will change the relative order.Please tell ur approach.
           </p><p>
              My approach would be in 0(n2) as below:-
              <br/>
              access 2 elements in one pass
             </p><p>
              for i=1…..n
             </p><p>
              if (element is +ve)
              <br/>
              i++;
              <br/>
              else
              <br/>
              find first +ve.
              <br/>
              Let it be index temp;
              <br/>
              now shift from i to temp(left shift) array.
              <br/>
              put +ve t i location then i++
             </p><p>
              Access second element
              <br/>
              if (-ve)
              <br/>
              i++
              <br/>
              else
              <br/>
              same as shifting.
             </p><p>
              goto to loop
             </p><p>
              This is to maintain same order and inplace.if order can be changed then o(n) sol is there,but for same order do we hve 0(n) sol.Above is the approach for 0(n2).
             </p><p>
          What could be the approach for interview round 1 question 2?
         </p><p>
            Just find the backwards distance that is from start to x and from end to y and the in-between distance that is from x+1th element to y-1th element. Return the minimum of the two

          @Arun jain:
          <br/>
          Could you please explain the approach for matrix problem for which the cheating is minimized. Do we also have to consider the diagonal position for cheating. I think if yes then it is a modified version of n-queens problem. And can you please also explain your approach. It will be helpful.
         </p><p>
            ya diagonal positions need to be considered…problem was to minimize cheating..it is not that if they sit two positions apart, they cant cheat…i initially approached with backtracking approach…..then he extended it to whether solution has optimal substructure property…. that is if we place k-1 students in optimal way then whether placing nth student in remaining positions will arrive us at total optimal solution or not?
           </p><p>
              @ARUN
              <br/>
              can you plz explain your solution.In n queen we have square matrix.plz tell the backtracking solution that you mentioned above and the optimal substructure if exists
             </p><p>
              @Arun
             </p><p>
              Can you plz elaborate your approach,Just a rough idea of backtracking answer that you gave and regarding optimal substructure..How can we relate to n queen whr we have n*n matrix and n queens,there it can be easily arranged.How can we arrange k into m*n.Plz explain
             </p><p>
              @Arun
             </p><p>
              Please explain your approach for this.how can we relate it to n queen whr we have n*n matrix with n queens.Please explain
             </p><p>
                Also Plese tell ur answer to optimal substructure ,it would be helpful.
               </p><p>
                Thanks
               </p><p>
          For Round 3 Q2. , a possible answer could be when the tree is completely left skewed or completely right skewed. Could we answer that? Can we also provide a sequence such that at every level of the tree , there is only one node
         </p><p>
            I also approached it in same way but problem is that head of list and root of tree will not point to same node….say  sequence is 1 2 3 4 5
            <br/>
            in linked list, sequence of head nodes will be
            <br/>
            1 then 2 then 3 so on….
            <br/>
            but for bst if we make new node as the child then always 1 will remain root node.
            <br/>
            1
            <br/>
            – 2
            <br/>
            -3
            <br/>
            so we need to make new node parent of present nodes…
           </p><p>
              @Arun.
              <br/>
              Since insertion in a link list is at the head,its head will always change,as a new element is inserted .
              <br/>
              But,the Head of BST never changes,Unless we are talking about Balanced BST .
              <br/>
              But,i doubt if we use balancing,their will then exist atleast 1 node,with 2 childs,hence failing the link list representation.
             </p><p>
              So,the answer may be either we insert 0 or 1 node accor to me.
             </p><p>
              What did you end up answering in the end.
             </p><p>
                @spandan
                <br/>
                @arun
               </p><p>
                It should be just that the linked list is sorted in nature.
                <br/>
                Having a sequence 12345, would make a linked list
                <br/>
                5&gt;4&gt;3&gt;2&gt;1
               </p><p>
                Its still a right skewed valid bst.
               </p><p>
                  sequence will be surely increasing or decreasing sequence…the tree is right skewed but its root will remain 1…in that case head and root are not pointing to same node… while inserting in tree new node should be made root of present tree
                 </p><p>
          Bar raise round, Q1, can it be done in O(n) space, O(n) time?
          <br/>
          my init idea is use LIS twice, and then sum them up
          <br/>
          LIS will take O(nlgn) time, and O(n) extra space.
          <br/>
          How did you archive it? Thanks
         </p><p>
          congrats  bro
         </p><p>
          What could be the approach for round 1 question 2?
         </p><p>
            Do a linear scan until we find x or y.
            <br/>
            when found save its index as idx.
            <br/>
            Now start from idx till end and check whether we find x or y,whenever found follow the following steps
           </p><p>
            If(current_element==idx element)
           </p><p>
            If yes,then check whether x and y are same and if same update min and mark this as idx and if x and y are not same just simply update idx only.
           </p><p>
            ELSE
           </p><p>
            If the current element found is diff than idx then ,if x and y are same then update idx only and  if x and y are diff then update idx and min_diff.
            <br/>
            Please correct if m wrng
           </p><p>
              If the current element found is diff than idx then ,if x and y are same then update idx only and if x and y are diff then update idx and min_diff.
              <br/>
              Please correct if m wrng
             </p><p>
              can you please elaborate..
              <br/>
              I think if ‘current_elment != idx element then it must be the other element so we can update min if it is less.
             </p><p>
                i checked if x and y are equal, then a flag variable was set to 1.
                <br/>
                min was updated in two cases.
                <br/>
                1.if curr element is equal to x or y and not equal to prev element
                <br/>
                or.
                <br/>
                2. flag variable is 1
               </p><p>
                  Could you please also explain the approach for the m*n matrox cheating problem ?
                 </p><p>
                  Following is my approach..
                  <br/>

          Can Anyone Explain the Solution for Q3 of Round 3,is it Similar to Coin Change Problem in Some Sense?
         </p><p>
            well its
           </p><p>
            possibility = (1/6)L(95, 10) + (1/6)L(96, 4)
           </p><p>
            where the L(X, Y) = (1/6)L(X-1, Y-1) + (1/6)L(X-2, Y-1) + (1/6)L(X-3, Y-1) + (1/6)L(X-4, Y-1) + (1/6)L(X-5, Y-1) + (1/6)L(X-6, Y-1)
           </p><p>
            with the base case L(X, 0) = 0,
            <br/>
            L(X, 1) = (1/6) if x&lt;=6,
            <br/>
            L(X, 1) = 0 otherwise

            You can use XOR operation to find the missing element very efficiently.
           </p><p>
              This procedure works best if you have unsorted array. In this question, since the array is sorted already, binary search procedure suggested by anonymous user is way efficient.

            I assume that the task is to figure out the starting index, given ‘one of the repeating elements.
           </p><p>
            Say element to be searched is ‘2.
            <br/>
            #1. Employ binary search till you find ‘2.
            <br/>
            #2. Check if its previous element(if exists) is different(than ‘2). If yes, return the current index.
            <br/>
            #3. else, binary search the left half with ‘2.
            <br/>
            Repeat the above steps till you find the first occurrence of ‘2 (viz check in step #2 is satisfied).
           </p><p>
            Note: We can compare search_elem with starting index of array also, in addition to comparison with mid element, to narrow down faster.
            <br/>
            If the start element of array is equals search_elem return the index
            <br/>
            else consider binary search on arr[start_index + 1 .. mid – 1]

          In the online test que 2, once you made a heap of first k+1 elements, how wud you remove the 1st element? Since it would be at some other index (swapped after making heap) ??

              Hey Please tell us about Hash+KMP algorithm?
             </p><p>
                KMP is separate algorithm for pattern searching and Hash is hash table. They are not combine
               </p><p>
                  Im just trying to ask whats your solution for Round 5 – Q5 other than Suffix tree, which is unclearly said
                 </p><p>
                  @Gokul.
                 </p><p>
                  I asked from Manager is data present in trie data structure or in hash table. When he told me it is present in Hash table then I wrote KMP pattern matching algorithm to match pattern given by user. I used clock_t variable to store the time on which user start entering the pattern to search name. After that I start taking input from the user If he is typing a number in a particular range I increase the count and when that range is passed then I see the lookup table on which I stored count and Integer value after that I take new time in clock_t variable and make count as 0 again. I mapped each user input and then create pattern. After that I searched in hash table for the desired Name who is containing that pattern and If I get then I print it.
                 </p><p>
              Do you mean a double ended queue??
             </p><p>
                Yes, It is doubly link list. on which we can delete or insert from both end.
               </p><p>
                  So, how to combine a heap with a doubly linked list?
                 </p><p>
            Really I dont understand your approach your 2nd approach other than suffix tree. Can you briefly tell us?
           </p><p>
              I asked from Manager is data present in trie data structure or in hash table. When he told me it is present in Hash table then I wrote KMP pattern matching algorithm to match pattern given by user.

I mapped each user input and then create pattern. After that I searched in hash table for the desired Name who is containing that pattern and If I get then I print it. I handled some more edge cases over that. Now I think you can think.
             </p><p>
                No, In the sense, you scan whole Hash for User input pattern every time the user halts giving input
                <br/>
                Then whats the use of hash? O(1) lookup
                <br/>
                Autocomplete is the answer i think the interviewer expected

          Hi,
         </p><p>
          You seem to have done really good. Its a matter of time, have faith in yourself.
          <br/>
          Also i wanted code for the following:
          <br/>
          Round5 – Ques 5 and Round3 – Q3.
          <br/>
          Thanks in advance
         </p><p>
          Hi,
         </p><p>
          Dont feel for it, may it be requirements are cancelled at that time. Your Spirit is important to be improved at this time. Practice more, so that may-be-happened mistakes will be broken without your knowledge. And Bounce Back. Try for other organisations too dude.
         </p><p>
          Can you describe your algorithm Round 5, Q5 – HASH+KMP implementation?
         </p><p>
          Could you please tell the answer you gave for F2F:R2-Q2
          <br/>
          &gt;&gt;&gt; 2. Give a Building with n floor. A person can take 1 step or 2 step to climb. Find the number of ways to reach nth floor.
         </p><p>
          But the mail they sent you seems to suggest that you were really good hence the positions they can offer at present does not do justice to your capabilities. Thats flattering to say the least.
         </p><p>
          Dont try to find any reason dude. It simply means u r not selected because somewhere you have done a goof up in any of the rounds.
         </p><p>
          But they will call you very soon for sure again. Be prepared. All the best.
         </p><p>
            I know there must be some reason in any round. But if I dont know that then I will repeat that mistake again in future. Thanks for your concern.

            Correct It is a fibonacci series. F(n-1)+F(n-2).I got the idea behind the solution of that through coin change problem in dynamic programming.

     Its not every day that you come across a person who has achieved so much in life at a very young age which others can only dream of achieving in their entire lifetime. His simplicity and positive attitude speak volumes for his recent success after facing some tough times.

      Team TopTalent: Can you tell us a bit about your background before joining IIT Madras?
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Sujeet:
     </strong>
     Sure. I hail from a small town called Kallam from Osmanabad district of Maharashtra. I studied in a local school in Marathi medium till 10th standard. I always thought people from cities would do much better than me as I studied every subject in Marathi. My mom and dad teach at a local college there. I am currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Madras. In IITJEE 2009, I secured an all India rank of 184
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Team TopTalent: Can you give us a brief account of your interview experience for these companies?
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Sujeet:
     </strong>
     All my interviews (except a couple) were technical interviews. Almost in each one, I had to tell what I did during my internships at Yahoo! and Facebook, what projects I have worked on. Many questions followed a similar monotone : arrays of integers, do something with them, biased coins and their tosses, trees and recursive algorithms, writing code on paper and explaining it to the interviewer, solving mathematical and logical puzzles etc. Interviews varied from very easy to very challenging. Some interviewers were impressed by JEE rank and CGPA while some did not give it even a second glance. Some interviewers were interested in the projects I did and asked detailed questions about it, while some were just interested in whether I can solve the problem they have given me.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Team TopTalent: So, how did it feel when you landed six massive offers on that day?
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Sujeet:
     </strong>
     It felt nice and gave an ego boost when people referred to me as "the guy with six offers". People I barely knew, smiling at me and congratulating me! I was on an all-time-high. Jumping around and laughing all the time. It was such a kick that the next day, although it was a normal and fine day, as it was down compared to previous days high, I was actually a bit gloomy!
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Team TopTalent: What was going through your mind when you had to choose one out of those 6 offers?
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Sujeet:
     </strong>
     I was supposed to finalize on a company by afternoon and I was in the state of utter confusion. Whether to take Google, which is the dream job of most of the programmers or to take Samsung, whose software division is nascent and where my contribution and impact would be much larger, visible and maybe even play a key part in companys direction or to take Goldman Sachs, the challenging job which I always wanted to get a taste of or to go with Tower Research, the highest paying Indian job (twice as high as the second highest) which also involves inviting challenges and lots of programming. I was realizing that it wasnt really a good idea after all to go for so many options. I was wondering whether I would have been better off without a choice, as all these companies were such that I would have accepted the offer without giving it any thought at all had it been the only offer. I finally decided to go with Google.
    </p><p>
     <em>

       first choice
      </a>
      for most Indian programmers)
     </em>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Team TopTalent: How did you prepare for these interviews? What suggestions can you give to our users who might have similar interviews lined up?
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Sujeet:
     </strong>
     I was lucky that I had discussed about similar questions before, and hence was able to make it through the interviews. I was quite attentive in class which really helped me a lot. Any questions which were not algorithm intensive questions and were more or less straight knowledge based, I could just recall the answer straight from the class when the professor taught that particular topic! Being friends with the right people and forming a peer group with a common interest is something which was critical to my success. I used to solve coding challenges with Arijit who had a very good Topcoder Rank. I would think about how I would solve those problem, if I get it, I would call him up and discuss the answer and ask for more.
    </p><p>
     In terms of suggestions, I would say be an active member of topcoder, keep solving programming problems in other places too if you want like spoj, usaco. I wish I had taken these things seriously and honed my algorithmic programming skills. Be thorough with Introduction to Algorithms by CLRS and do problems on one of the above mentioned sites.

     <br/>
     <strong>
      1.
     </strong>
     Generate all valid permutations using ‘(‘ and ‘). Valid permutation is the general definition of valid sequence of the opening and closing brackets.
    </p><p>
     I told him a solution where we would generate a combination using a recursive solution and prune the cases where a valid combination is no longer possible. The solution was fine and not that difficult. But the interviewer was very interested in knowing if I can calculate the complexity of the solution. He gave me some hints but it was just not striking me. I told him my approximate answer. We moved on.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      2.
     </strong>
     Create an ancestor matrix for a tree.
    </p><p>
     The solution would seem simple. But since the matrix is N*N, the interviewer wanted some tricks to reduce the complexity of the write operation on the matrix.
    </p><p>
     I told him a solution where you can initialize the matrix with all zeros and only write 1 for the ancestor cell using a modifies recursive solution and linkedlist.
     <br/>
     He was fine with the solution
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      F2F 2:

    </p><p>
     <strong>
      1.
     </strong>
     Find the maximum weight node in a tree if each node is the sum of the weights all the nodes under it. Obviously tree nodes can have negative weights.

      F2F 3:

     <strong>
      1.
     </strong>
     Find the diameter of a tree.

     Link every node of a level to the the next node at the same level
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      3.
     </strong>
     Find the first subarray which has a zero sum in an array
    </p><p>

     1.For every problem, give one simple solution first (may have more time complexity) and think for optimal solution.
    </p><p>
     2.Write a code in clear manner. It should be understandable without your explanation.
    </p><p>
     3.In a position to tell complexity for code you are going to write.
    </p><p>
     4.First tell the algorithm or approach and proceed with writing code.
    </p><p>
     5.Do not hesitate to ask for clarification. They will impress.
    </p><p>
     Thats all from my side.  Best of luck.

     There are some glasses with equal volume 1 litre. The glasses kept as follows
    </p><p>
     You can put water to only top glass. If you put more than 1 litre water to 1st glass, water overflow and fill equally both 2nd and 3rd glass. Glass 5 will get water from both 2nd glass and 3rd glass and so on..
     <br/>
     If you have X litre of water and you put that water in top glass, so tell me how much water contained by jth glass in ith row.
     <br/>
     Example. If you will put 2 litre on top.
     <br/>
     1st – 1 litre

          congrats man ! awesome !

          @Kartik: I dont think All elements of jth row will contain same amount of water.
          <br/>
          because after 5 litre water is put than the state will be
          <br/>
          1
          <br/>
          1   1
          <br/>
          .5   1   .5
         </p><p>
          and after this state 6th litre will be distributed and the state will be
          <br/>
          1
          <br/>
          1   1
          <br/>
          .75   1   .75
          <br/>
          0  .25  .25   0
         </p><p>
          So can any one suggest the approach and find the pattern of ditribution..??
         </p><p>
          I dont think all glasses in same level will have same volume of water because …5 is being filled by 2 &amp; 3 at the same time ….so ..5 will fill up twice as fast compared to 4 &amp; 6.
         </p><p>
          I think this will form pascal triangle.
         </p><p>
          glass 1 fills with rate i;
          <br/>
          glass 2 &amp; 3 fills with rate i;
          <br/>
          glass 4 &amp; 6 fills with rate i and 5 fills with 2*i;
         </p><p>
          so at any time ….5 will have twice as volume as 4 &amp; 6 before it gets completely filled.
         </p><p>
          I think solution can be on these lines … .
         </p><p>
          if i is the number of row :
         </p><p>
          if i(i+1)/2 &lt;= X return 1;
         </p><p>
          if i(i-1)/2  X return
          <br/>
          ((i, j)th pascal number/sum of ith row)*(X-i(i+1)/2);
         </p><p>
          else return 0;
         </p><p>
          Can any one explain the trick to solve the 2nd question of 2nd round?
         </p><p>
              Karthik :
              <br/>
              Problem is much more complex than that.
              <br/>
              " All glasses in a row will not have same amount of water" . Glasses at edges will be filled later as compared to inner glasses in any particular row. eg: For if total water is 6L, then Glass 4 will have will have 3/4L , Glass 5 will have 1L,Glass 6 will have 3/4L,Glass 8 and 9 will both have 1/4L each.
             </p><p>
              @Karthik : ur soln is wrong.
              <br/>
              All the glasses in the row will not have  same amount of water,check out ,take the case that 2 and 3 overflows x amount each then 4 will receive x/2 and 5 will receive x/2 + x/2 = x and 6 will receive only x/2.
             </p><p>
            Rohit Pathania : Following code will work for this problem.
           </p><p>
            "array" is 2D array here whose all values are initialized to 0.It is representing water in respective glasses. It works as follow. "fillWater" method fills this 2D array one by one considering the total amount of water from top to bottom in triangular fashion. If at any location, water is more than 1,then remaining water(i.e water -1 ) will be flown to array[i+1][j] and array[i+1][j+1] equally i.e to its immediate two children. In this way , you can fill the total water in glasses(as it works in real life example) and at the end u can access any (i,j)th glass using array[i-1][j-1] location to get the water in that particular glass.

        Convert a BST to a Binary Tree such that sum of all greater keys is added to every key
       </h2><p>
     Given a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Binary Tree such that every key of the original BST is changed to key plus sum of all greater keys in BST.

      Convert a BST
     </a>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Solution:
     </strong>
     Do reverse Inoorder traversal. Keep track of the sum of nodes visited so far. Let this sum be
     <em>
      sum
     </em>
     . For every node currently being visited, first add the key of this node to
     <em>
      sum
     </em>
     , i.e.
     <em>
      sum
     </em>
     =
     <em>
      sum
     </em>
     +
     <em>
      node-&gt;key
     </em>
     . Then change the key of current node to
     <em>
      sum
     </em>
     , i.e.,
     <em>
      node-&gt;key = sum
     </em>
     .
     <br/>
     When a BST is being traversed in reverse Inorder, for every key currently being visited, all keys that are already visited are all greater keys.
    </p><p>
     Output:
    </p><p>
     Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in given Binary Search Tree.

          i feel pointer to primitive type here its int is similar to static variable. So we can get rid of this by simple saying that node.value= node.value+right(here right is the sum of the values greater than this nodes value)

          atlast return left value Please refer to the code below.

          <br/>
          can u plz explain "design data structure of O(1) in round 2″ in this set?
         </p><p>
          Any ideas on "Given an array of numbers if we start deleting numbers from end of array, then we have to tell the maximum element of the array after deletion in O(1)."
         </p><p>
          How did you solve round 2 Question 1?
         </p><p>
          What is the difference between Hashtable, hashmap, linked hashtable and linked hash map??
         </p><p>
          great ..congrats
         </p><p>
          first one is better
         </p><p>
            nice solution for a[i][j];
           </p><p>
              How is first one better?
             </p><p>
                because 2d matrix is stored in memory row-wise and thus accessing the elements needs less time in the first case
               </p><p>
          probably
         </p><p>
          cout&lt;&lt;a[i][j];
         </p><p>
          cout&lt;&lt;a[j][j];
         </p><p>
          I guess you meant to say the following:
         </p><p>
          How did you solve the question on design of hash table?
         </p><p>
            Look up for "Linked Hash Map". Java has an implementation for it.
            <br/>
            Basically, every element (key/val pair node) also points to  an element inserted before it in time, and element inserted after it. So, all the elements form a doubly linked list virtually.
           </p><p>

     <strong>
      Shortlisting Round.
     </strong>
     <br/>
     There were 20 MCQ and 2 programming questions. Each correct answer carried 1 mark and -0.25 for a wrong answer. Programming questions were:
    </p><p>
     a.  Given a number with the number of digits in the range of 10-50, find the next higher permutation of the number. If such a number doesnt exist, return -1.
    </p><p>
     b. Given an array of strings, you need to find the longest running sequence of a character among all possible permutations of the strings in the array.
     <br/>
     INPUT:
     <br/>
     ab
     <br/>
     ba
     <br/>
     aac
     <br/>
     OUTPUT:
     <br/>
     a,3
    </p><p>
     Then there were 4 rounds of interview.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      T1
     </strong>
     <br/>
     a. Given link list segregate odd elements first and even elements afterwards.
    </p><p>
     b. Given a BST of memory sizes. Find best fit for a memory block of size M.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      T2.
     </strong>
     <br/>
     a. Given 2 sorted arrays of size m and n+m(with n elements) , merge
     <br/>
     them into the latter..
     <br/>
     b. Given a character array find the first element that repeats itself.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      T3.
     </strong>
     <br/>
     a. Given a binary tree connect all nodes in a level through link list.
    </p><p>
     b. Some question related to share market which boiled down to find maximum difference between two elements such that second element appears after the first one.
    </p><p>
     c. What is thrashing ?
    </p><p>
     d. Real world application of heaps?
    </p><p>
     e. Minimum spanning tree and topological sort .
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      T4.
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Around half an hour HR then
     <br/>
     Given a function node* inplacemergesort(node* n1, node* n2) which takes 2 linked lists as input and performs in-place merge sort and returns the final list.  How will you test it and make sure it does what it claims.
    </p><p>
     I was hired

          Shouldnt for next higher permutation, the coding would be very easy.
         </p><p>
          The number should lie between 10-50,hence the main logic should only check whether the 2nd digit of our number is greater than the 1st?
          <br/>
          If yes, print the reversed number [e.g. -&gt; for 36, o/p should be 64].
          <br/>
          If no, just print -1.
         </p><p>
          Plz correct, if Im missing something.
         </p><p>
            It is given that the number of digits in the number are in the range of 10 to 50. The outcome of all possible permutation will be huge, 50!.
           </p><p>
            However, finding next higher permutation is easy.

          Finding next permutation. Decipher the logic
          <img alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" src="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif"/>
          easy!!!
         </p><p>
            Example to justify the "Search" (SearchHigher) call on the sorted-right of the first inversion pair.
           </p><p>
            it will not work for A = {1,4,3,2,1}
           </p><p>
              It is expected that the numbers are unique. Duplicates are special case.
             </p><p>
          for the first permutation problem, what solution did u gave,
          <br/>
          Does finding all peremutaions(o(nlogn) and rank them , then print the number having rank just greater than i/p number rank?
         </p><p>
          Or did you have a better solution?

        Amazon Interview | Set 20
       </h2><p>
     <strong>
      Recently got interviewed with amazon Hyderabad for SDE1.
     </strong>
     <span id="more-114710">
     </span>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Written
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1) Given a BST, along with left and right pointer for a node, it has forward and backward pointers, convert the tree into Doubly linked list using these extra pointers.
    </p><p>
     2) A = {5, 3, 8, 9, 16}
     <br/>
     After one iteration A = {3-5,8-3,9-8,16-9}={-2,5,1,7}
     <br/>
     After second iteration A = {5-(-2),1-5,7-1} sum =7+(-4)+6=9
     <br/>
     Given an array, return sum after n iterations
    </p><p>
     3) Write a function which compress string AAACCCBBD to A3C3B2D
     <br/>
     and other function to generate from the compressed.
    </p><p>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      First f2f)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1) Check given BT is BST
    </p><p>
     2) The cost of a stock on each day is given in an array, find the max profit that you can make by buying and selling in those days
    </p><p>
     3) In matrix A[m][n] each row is sorted and each column is sorted, write a function which checks whether a number exists in this matrix or not.
    </p><p>
     4) Given a string, find the longest sub sequence which contains only unique characters.
    </p><p>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Second -f2f)
     </strong>
     <strong>
      <br/>
     </strong>
     1) Convert a BT into SUM BT(each node values = sum of left and right node)
    </p><p>
     2) "I get thousands of emails daily", find all anagrams in each email and print the count of all anagrams in each email.
     <br/>
     My solution was using a trie and a hash function to increase the counter at each node in the trie.
     <br/>
     Hash function will return the given word in a sorted manner, he asked me to code which was tedious but gave a rough draft.
     <br/>
     Initial set up cost would be big but the same trie can be used for any email by making all counters to zero.
    </p><p>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Third f2f)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1) He talked almost for 45 min regarding my project and asked how we implement it. I was also working on web services in my current company, so they were more interested in asking questions there and want to know how well I implemented there.
    </p><p>
     2) A design question of chess int board[8][8] each value in the matrix represents a character. 1-9 number represents all whites and 11-19 represents all blacks.
     <br/>
     Given a pawn at (x,y) print all possible moves. Assume whites are index 0 and blacks are at index 7.
    </p><p>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Fourth f2f)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1) There is ternary tree in two dimension space(one plane). Print all elements that are visible from right side of the plane(If you see along y axis plane)
     <br/>
     eg) In the following answer would be (1) (5) (8)
     <br/>
     ————————(1)—————————————
     <br/>
     —————-(2)–(3)–(4)–(5)——————————
     <br/>
     ———-(6)–(7)–(8)—————————————–
    </p><p>
     2) Print these elements in a zig zag order, first level1 and then level n, level 2 and level n-1 and so on.
    </p><p>
     In simpler words print rightmost ending element in each level of a ternary tree.
     <br/>
     My approach was take two queues, enqueue root in Q1 and while dequeueing enqueue its childeren in Q2, while shuffling elements from one queue to another store the last element in doubly linked list.
     <br/>
     While printing, use this double linked list, remove from head and then tail, till it becomes empty.
    </p><p>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Fifth f2f)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     1) Find jth element in ith row of a pascal triangle
    </p><p>
     1
     <br/>
     1 1
     <br/>
     1 2 1
     <br/>
     1 3 3 1
     <br/>
     1 4 6 4 1… and son on. pascal(4,2) should return 6.
    </p><p>
     complexity is bad and I am not grouping the solution once calculated of sub problems
    </p><p>
     2) Implement your own hash function with keys as strings and values is of type Object
     <br/>
     initially I told BST with insertion deletion of order log(n), then he told me to think and answer then I told self balancing BST and he asked me to implement,
    </p><p>
     3) Evaluate a mathematical expression 2*3+(5-6/2), something like this, with operator priority.
    </p><p>
     Each f2f interview will be of 50-60 min. In each f2f round they will ask reason for change, and about your current project. You should answer perfectly regarding your current project and dont blabber something and all, they will ask good questions in the current project as well.
     <br/>
     These questions might take up more than 15-20 min and in the rest of the time you have to answer 2 question in DS for minimum and code them as well.
     <br/>
     If you answer you will get one more question which is an advantage
     <img alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" src="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif"/>
     <br/>
     First he will explain the question and gives you sometime.
     <br/>
     You need to explain the solution first, if he likes it, then he will asks you to write production code and takes the paper.
    </p><p>
     Each interview is not like a level in amazon, they wont share feedback neither with you nor with other interviewers.
    </p><p>
     After the interview process is done all those who took your interview will sit and judge (Thats what HR told me
     <img alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" src="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif"/>
     )
    </p><p>
     All the interviewers were friendly, finally I got a call from HR saying that I was selected

          is there any tricky way to do q2 of written type or simply brute forcing
         </p><p>
          will this approach to find largest sequence of unique characters will work or not:
          <br/>
          what i am thinking to use is divide and conquer technique :
          <br/>
          1)divide string in two halfs
          <br/>
          2) do recursively the following steps
          <br/>
          a)check in left half
          <br/>
          b)check in right half
          <br/>
          c)check for sequence of character that may cross mid element

          For the written Q2-
          <br/>
          calculate the power of 11 n times and store in array.
          <br/>
          it will have n+1 digits.
          <br/>
          take 1st consecutive n+1 digits.multiply the digits of 11^n stored in array with the elements of array taken n+1 at a time.putting + and – sign alternatively.
          <br/>
          taking above example  {5, 3, 8, 9, 16}
          <br/>
          if n= 2
          <br/>
          11^2 = 121 so store like this {1,-2,1}
          <br/>
          take 3 at a time
          <br/>
          5,3,8 = 5-2*3+8 = 7
          <br/>
          9,8,3 = 9-2*8+3 = -4
          <br/>
          8,9,16 = 8-2*9 +16 = 6
          <br/>
          now sum these
          <br/>
          7-4+6 = 9
          <br/>
          if it is asked for 3 iterations the co-efficients for multiplication will be {1,-3,3,-1}
          <br/>
          and multiply from end .
          <br/>
          {5,3,8,9} will be multiplied as 1*9-3*8+3*3-1*5 = -11
          <br/>
          {3,8,9,16}  will be 1*16-3*9 +3*8 -3 =10
          <br/>
          sum =-1
          <br/>
          This is one of the solution.But this seems a little overkill.
          <br/>
          There might be easier solution.Please comment.
         </p><p>
            It would be pascal triangle not 11^n
            <br/>
            like
            <br/>
            11
            <br/>
            then 121

          SWAPPING OF TWO NODES OF LINKED LISTS
          <br/>
          Approach:Basically there are two approaches to solve the problem:to swap the values of the nodes or to swap the pointers.In this SET i have just swapped the values of the nodes without swapping the pointers which will be shown in the later posts.
         </p><p>
          STEPS:1.Calculate the size of the linked lists and pass the positions of the nodes which you want to swap.
         </p><p>
          2.If the positions are more than the size of the list then print enter the correct positions and check if the second position is more than the first one.
         </p><p>
          3.Now take two pointers and take them to the desired positions of the nodes of whose values you want to swap and swap the values.

          Q1 R1 :
          <br/>
          This should work , can someone check ?
         </p><p>
          round 1, question 1 :
          <br/>
          " Q1. For a given number, find the next greatest number which is just greater than previous one and made up of same digits. "
         </p><p>
          clarification : if given 125341 should the output be 125342 or 125431
          <br/>
          ie, are we just comparing the "set" or numbers or the multiset ?
         </p><p>
          I think the following algorithm works for the case of multiset :
          <br/>
          Given number N with decimal digits : d1, d2, ..
          <br/>
          1) for each digit, find the closest digit to the left of it that is strictly smaller than it.
          <br/>
          2) scanning from the right most digit, take the first digit that has another digit
          <br/>
          from step 1) that is smaller than it. Swap the two digits.
          <br/>
          3) return the number from step 2) if found some number in step 2.
         </p><p>
          comments:
          <br/>
          step 1) can be done in O(N) , N number of digits, time using this algorithm:
          <br/>
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_nearest_smaller_values" rel="nofollow">
           http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_nearest_smaller_values
          </a>
          <br/>
          step 2) can be avoided if we just keep track of the last index such that
          <br/>
          there exists an smaller element, and also the index of the smaller element.
          <br/>
          The total time for this algorithm is O(N) where N is the number of digits
         </p><p>
          ==================================================================
         </p><p>
          example ( use ‘-‘ to denote that there is nothing to the left of the digit that is smaller than it)
          <br/>
          input:
          <br/>
          125341
          <br/>
          digit to the left that is smaller, (aligned vertically to the number 125341)
          <br/>
          -1223-
          <br/>
          the first digit from the right that has a smaller digit is ‘4. So the output is
          <br/>
          125431
         </p><p>
          example 2
          <br/>
          input:
          <br/>
          735628
          <br/>
          digit to the left that is smaller, (aligned vertically to the number 735628)
          <br/>
          –35-2
          <br/>
          the first digit from the right that has a smaller digit is ‘8. So the output is
          <br/>
          735682
         </p><p>
            What about 1132?
            <br/>
            1132
            <br/>
            –11
            <br/>
            it comes out to be 1231
           </p><p>
            but we need 1213.

          Some doubts :
          <br/>
          a. In Round 4 Qs 1 Can we use an array ?
          <br/>
          b. What is a sorted binary tree ? U mean a binary search tree?
         </p><p>
          In Round3 Qs 1… Is there no other property given as in.. the relationship between left and parent or right or parent… If not this can be reduced to a simple priority linked list insertion problem.

          Round 2 Question 1:
         </p><p>
          Time complexity O(n)
         </p><p>
            thanks
           </p><p>
            Can you pls explain your logic?
           </p><p>
              predecessor will return the smallest node and successor will return the largest node of the current tree.
             </p><p>
              temp_successor is the largest node of left child and its successor would be root.
             </p><p>
              temp_predecessor is the smallest node of the right child and that is roots successor.
             </p><p>
              For each node, the code will first recursively set its left and right sub-tree and then return its predecessor and successor. You can check for predecessor pointing to root as well as root pointing to successor and accordingly set it null.
             </p><p>
                It is binary tree , not BST …so predecessor may not be smaller node than current node….i am still not getting your approach….for not at the most left this solution is coming wrong…please explain..

         </p><p>
            answer for round 1 question 1
           </p><p>
            This algo takes O(n^2). Use post order traversal and mark
            <br/>
            each node with (left)0/1(right) in each level.
           </p><p>
            Suppose a node has its string as 00 then if random index
            <br/>
            points to 00xyx.. then random node is a successor.
           </p><p>
            If you assume comparing first ‘n indexes a const. then
            <br/>
            total working time is O(n).
           </p><p>
            Why is this looking for ancestor when the question asks for successor?

          Hi Mohit
         </p><p>
          Could you please elaborate 3rd Round 2nd question ?
         </p><p>
            Hi all,
            <br/>
            As some guys are requesting for stocks ques explanation, here it is.
            <br/>
            I had given a similar approach to the below:
            <br/>
            <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maximum-difference-between-two-elements/" rel="nofollow">
             http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maximum-difference-between-two-elements/
            </a>
           </p><p>
            I maintained the following pointers:
            <br/>
            1. minIndex – Index to min Value.
            <br/>
            2. maxIndex – Index to max Value.
            <br/>
            3. nextMinIndex  – Index to value &lt; minIndexs Value and
            <br/>
            nextMinIndex &gt; maxIndex.
           </p><p>
            I dont remember the exact implementations but below was my algo:
            <br/>
            1. Initialize minIndex = maxIndex = 0;
            <br/>
            2. Loop through the array from 1 to n-1.
            <br/>
            a. If A[i] &lt; A[minIndex],
            <br/>
            nextMinIndex = i;
           </p><p>
            // Update the minIndex as now nextMinIndex comes after
            <br/>
            the maxIndex.
            <br/>
            b. Else if A[i] &gt; A[maxIndex]
            <br/>
            maxIndex = i+1;
            <br/>
            if (minIndex != nextMinIndex)
            <br/>
            minIndex = nextMinIndex;
            <br/>
            3. If minIndex == maxIndex, [no, answer exists]
            <br/>
            4. Else,
            <br/>
            Print the minIndex[Day to buy], maxIndex[Day to sell] &amp; A[maxIndex] – A[minIndex](max Profit).
           </p><p>
            Done.

            O(n) solution.
           </p><p>
          While asking for min-heap question, did they also ask you to write the code or were they just looking at your approach??
         </p><p>
            Just the approach.
           </p><p>
          any good answers for this one:
         </p><p>
          An array of elements have been given. Find for each element, first max element to its right.
         </p><p>
            Little modification to the following post can do,
           </p><p>

            </a>
           </p><p>
              Yes, I had told him the stack approach from the above solution.
             </p><p>
          Find top k searched elements from a continuous stream of data.
         </p><p>
          How did you solved this ?
         </p><p>
            Use a min heap of size k for this. Whenever a element arrives, check it with the top of the heap and if it is larger replace the top element with the said element and heapify it.
           </p><p>
              This is wrong, the question is different from selecting k largest numbers in a stream. It should select the k numbers with most frequencies.
             </p><p>
              If we can store the frequencies in a data structure, then the problem becomes simple.
             </p><p>
            Hi,
            <br/>
            I guess the solution would be like this …..
            <br/>
            You have a continuous stream of numbers now its obvious that some numbers would be repeated in that stream. Now you will make a heap with three fields number, position(means when its first repeated) and its count(number of repetition ). Now based on the count of those number you have to arrange your heap.
            <br/>
            One exception would be when you have the count of each number same.If count of each number is one in that case you just print last k numbers as they were the last top and recently searched numbers. If count (but equal) is something else then we just heapyfy as per the position field(higher position will have higher priority) and find out the top k numbers.
           </p><p>
            Please let me know if I have missed any case.
           </p><p>
              Use a heap + hash? still dont think using a heap is good enough.
             </p><p>
            I initially had explained what Nikhil shared, but he came back with the constraint that the data is being presented as a stream of data.
            <br/>
            Also, we cant simply search for greater than.[We need to find top k searched elements[means to check the number of times they are searched] and not top k highest elements]
           </p><p>
            If we go ahead with this approach, then say in the last 1 hr, a particular product, "X" has been searched for greater than any element in the heap but would not become part of heap as we are not storing any count of elements that are not already present in the heap.
           </p><p>
            I replied by saying that we can maintain a heap of all elements but then searching would take O(n).
           </p><p>
            So search was a bottleneck, so went back to hashtables. We need to use one and store all elements with their counts.
           </p><p>
            1. Build a min heap of size k O(k).
            <br/>
            For next (n-k) elements:
            <br/>
            2. Whenever we read the element, we increment its count and compare it with root of the heap. O(1+1)
            <br/>
            3. If greater, we simply replace and call heapify. O(lgk)
           </p><p>
            Complexity would be :
            <br/>
            O(k + n-k(1 + 1 + lgk)) = O(nlgk)
           </p><p>
            Done.
            <img alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" src="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif"/>
           </p><p>
              Not to be ambiguous,
              <br/>
              When I say compare with root of the heap, I mean compare the count of the elements.
             </p><p>
              While building hastable, how will you know the size of hashtable as it is a continuous stream of data and you dont know when will the maximum element arrive?
             </p><p>
                We dont need to initialize the hashtable at start.
                <br/>
                This would have been a real time application and hence need to store all elements.
               </p><p>
                Also, we both were java developer and Collection package solves our dynamic hashtable problem.
               </p><p>
              why do u compare with root only..if at any instant of time ,we have to show top k searched elements then it should be compared with all elements..plz rply

            Hi srikanth..Plz help in two quetions:-
            <br/>
            Q1. Given a large file which contains m rows and n columns. Given a column no, sort the column in such a way that corresponding rows also sorted
            <br/>
            Swapping entire rows will take a lot of time..Can we just swap the pointers only ??wats ur approach?
           </p><p>
            Q2. Path in matrix with 1s from source to dest.I have solution using backtrack..is their any better approach….
           </p><p>
            Please reply soon
           </p><p>
            Thnx
           </p><p>
              And in the Tree question…Link u have provided says we need to find parity in k-1.Say,i am at level 2 and i need 2nd…But k-1 has parity 0 as 0 number of 1….so answer is 0..how it comes to be 1 as per ur parity concept/??
             </p><p>
              For the 4th level  01101001
             </p><p>
              If i need to find 5th node how then k-1 node has  2 ones which is even??how it come out to be 1 as per ur logic…please correct me if m wrng….
             </p><p>
              thnx
              <br/>

          What is meant by "two trees" are isomorphic??

          @Shrikanth How long did Amzon take to inform you after the F2F interviews?
         </p><p>
            I had given interview on 15th. I got regret mail on 17th evening

          sorry, "append the node", not "append the list"
         </p><p>
          Round 3 Question 1 :
         </p><p>
          Basically, you are doing a BFS. Keeping a counter of how many nodes
          <br/>
          you have at the next level, starting with level 1, with 1 node, (the root)
         </p><p>

              yes, as I have said : "comments:
              <br/>
              auxQueue can be avoided by rewriting the code to determining if you
              <br/>
              are in the middle of traversing the level. If you are, keep a pointer
              <br/>
              to the previous node and link its right pointer to this node."
             </p><p>
              your solution requires using null pointers as boundary. You dont need that. You just need an integer to count the number of nodes in the next level as you BFS.
             </p><p>
            It cab be solved using one queue only. See below code

         </p><p>
          First, we find the overall position of the node in level order traversal. Then, we find the parent by taking the node value div 2, and keep track of if we came from left, or right :

            awesome. I couldnt get this at that time
           </p><p>
            There is other way also.
            <br/>
            If there are 2n bits, first n bits would be exactly same as previous and the next n bits would be negation of first n bits. We can use this property and go in recursion
           </p><p>
          Ans for R3 Q2…
          <br/>
          Begin traversing the linked list:
          <br/>
          1) If the node value is 2, move to the end of the list
          <br/>
          2) If the node value is 0, move to the beginning of the list
          <br/>
          3) If the node value is 1, leave it as it is.
         </p><p>
          At the end of the traversal, the Linked List should be sorted
         </p><p>
            I think the question is that there is a very big list which contains only 3 numbers 1,2 and 3.
            <br/>
            1-&gt;2-&gt;1-&gt;3-&gt;2-&gt;3
            <br/>
            o/p should be
            <br/>
            1-&gt;1-&gt;2-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;3
           </p><p>
          How to solve Round 3 question 2??
          <br/>
          in given complexity
         </p><p>
            nice solution. Another way is to keep 3 pointers
            <br/>
            p1, p2, p3. Initially set to null.
           </p><p>
            traverse the list, when you see an 1, append the list to the end of p1, and similarily for values 2, and 3.
            <br/>
            At the end ,just stitch
            <br/>
            p1 -&gt; p2 -&gt; p3, taking care of possible null pointers.

          Hi shredder,
         </p><p>
          What did you answered for round 5question 5?
         </p><p>
          Can someone give the solution for the 2nd problem in Online Coding Test? Or atleast tell me the approach. Although a hint is given, its not clear to me.
         </p><p>
            Create a min heap on first k elements of Array A. O(K)
            <br/>
            Extract min to get the min element for Array B.
            <br/>
            Iterate over array A, At each iteration, extract the min element of the heap and insert the new element of array A into the heap.
            <br/>
            Time for each iteration -&gt; O(log k)
           </p><p>
            Total time -&gt; O(K) + n*O(log k) = O(n * log k)
           </p><p>
              This is Wrong approach.
              <br/>
              This is a sliding window problem.
              <br/>
              It can be solved using dequeu.
             </p><p>
                Where is the fallacy in the approach?
                <br/>
                Please explain your approach.
               </p><p>
                  Think for yourself.
                  <br/>
                  You said "Extract min to get the min element for Array B"
                  <br/>
                  You are extracting the element, but it may be the minimum for next set of k values also.
                  <br/>
                  We need to remove the first element from the set of k values and add a new value from each iteration.And from the set get the minimum.
                 </p><p>
                  By extracting I meant taking it out from the data structure. It is not there any more after extraction.
                 </p><p>
                  It doesnt really say that we exclude the elements already selected.

                  When you iterate through A. Do you have to build a new heap for every i to i+k?

          Hey Shredder,
         </p><p>
          I am recently having an online coding round for amazon. Can you tell me if for your online test.. did you have to write entire code or only a function? Also do you need to compile it? And after how much time of the online test was your phone screen?
         </p><p>
            Only the functions.
            <br/>
            Compile it. Validation will be done on the test cases.
           </p><p>
            See a sample here(someone posted this link on Geeksforgeeks)

              I am using BFS method to explore the cell that is farthest from thee guards. For this, I initialized a queue. All the guard cells are added to queue with distance marked as zero. Now for each cell in the queue, mark its neighbors(if not added previously to avoid the loop) and add to queue after increasing the distance value by one. After processing, the final will be the node farthest from the guards.

          How you approached for bucket water problem..round 3 first problem
         </p><p>
            Use the following code to find the position of the bucket in a 2D space and then you can procedd with the algorithm described here on

            Hey, Ill try to explain.
            <br/>
            take a variable level initialized to 1.
            <br/>
            Suppose we have x L of water on first glass, therefore overflow=x-1.
            <br/>
            //I am taking array from index 1.
            <br/>
            for(int i=1,curr=1;i&lt; =n;i++,curr++){
            <br/>
            if(a[i]&gt;1){
            <br/>
            a[i+level]=(a[i]-1)/2;
            <br/>
            a[i+level+1]=(a[i]-1)/2;
            <br/>
            }
            <br/>
            if(curr&gt;level){
            <br/>
            level++;
            <br/>
            curr=1;
            <br/>
            }
            <br/>
            }
           </p><p>
            Try to visualize it as a binary tree, though it is clearly not one, but try. You will see that every bucket after filling to the brim start overflowing and in turn gives down further to its child buckets. The relationship between parent and child is that parent at ith level will have i+level and i+level+1 as its child, so now you can traverse the array and where you find the overflow condition just fill the child with half each.

          I also gave 2 rounds of the process,first was online programming test and other was a telephonic interview.
          <br/>
          I gave the 2nd round last week and it went well but havnt got any reply from their side yet.So can u pls tell me how much gap was there in ur interview rounds.Means shud i hope for a call or just move on.

          Hello Shredder,
         </p><p>
          Could you plz share a bit info upon, how you approached the questions on locks and guards (Round 2, Question 2) and the design question on stocks. (Round 5 Qn:5)
         </p><p>
          Thanks a lot!
         </p><p>
            Locks and guards matrix:
            <br/>
            Convert the given matrix into a graph. Note that the locked rooms will be disconnected nodes of the graph. A node in graph can have at most 4 edges.
            <br/>
            If we perform BFS from a guarded node, we will obtain shortest distances from that guarded node to all other nodes. So, we can perform BFS from all guarded nodes to get the distances of all nodes from each guards. Use these distance arrays to get the answer. But this approach takes O(n^4) time.
            <br/>
            To optimize this, collapse all guarded nodes into one node. Perform BFS from that node. This makes it O(n^2) times.
            <br/>
            PS. Here nodes will be rooms in matrix.
           </p><p>
            Regarding the data structure for storing STOCK prices, I am still not sure if I have some solid approaches. I discussed various arrays,linked list, segment trees based approaches indexed with timestamps. It was more of discussion. I am looking forward to some good insights if someone can provide here.
           </p><p>
              "collapse all guarded nodes into one node" please explain it a bit.
             </p><p>

                <br/>
                Wish I had a cleaner(with less edges) graph!
               </p><p>
                By collapsing what I meant was introduce a new node G and add edges from G to all nodes which have edges to some Gi(some guarded node). Remove all Gi are this. So, you will have only one guarded node in the graph now. Perform BFS using that node.
               </p><p>
          How did you manage to solve f2f round 1 q2 without modifying the original list? The answer in gfg here:
          <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/a-linked-list-with-next-and-arbit-pointer/" rel="nofollow">
           http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/a-linked-list-with-next-and-arbit-pointer/
          </a>
          <br/>
          modifies the list in both solutions.
         </p><p>
            The only solution that I can think of is(assuming key values do not matter)
            <br/>
            1) You copy the original linked list.
            <br/>
            2) While copying you save references to each node of the copied list in say an array.
            <br/>
            3) In the original list for each node, check node-&gt;arbit value
            <br/>
            4) Lookup the value from 3 in the arr of saved references and assign copynode-&gt;arbit to it.
           </p><p>
            Takes O(n) space and time. Anyone welcome to correct me of any mistakes.
           </p><p>
              What if there are nodes with duplicate value.
             </p><p>
                Nice..hadnt thought of that. Then how about this
               </p><p>
                1) You save the references of each node of the original list in an array while copying.
               </p><p>
                2) Then for each node, do node-&gt;arbit and lookup the reference in the array.
               </p><p>
                3) The (array index – current location) value would give you the offset to traverse from the current node for the arbit to point to.
               </p><p>
                  I do not think that it is possible to solve this problem in O(n) time and space without modifying the original list.
                  <br/>
                  It can be solved in O(n log n) time and O(n) space using the sorted array of references of the nodes of the old list. (I am using the sorted array just to improve the search time to find the random pointer references.)
                 </p><p>
          Can Anyone pl explain me the Object Oriented design for ‘Snake and Ladder Game or ‘Stock Market. Means how will I start for that??
          <br/>
          I dont have any idea means how to start from scratch.
          <br/>
          Pl. Anyone give me some idea on that. Or tell me from where I will get idea on that by which I can catch it as early as possible.

          Given a binary tree. Find two numbers in the tree whose sum is k. If there are no such elements, state so. Assume that the tree is balanced.
         </p><p>
            Apologies. This was a binary search tree.
            <br/>
            Mods can you pelase correct it.
            <br/>
            Thanks.

            Do inorder traversal using stacks.
            <br/>
            This is iterative process.
            <br/>
            Perform this using two stacks. One for inorder traversal and other for reverse inorder traversal.
            <br/>
            Pop/push the elements from the stack based on whether their sum is =0.
           </p><p>
            To get the feel, assume that you have a sorted array. How would you find two numbers whose sum is k in linear time?
            <br/>
            Start from ends, and  move based on sum of the numbers, until you find two concerned numbers.

        Amazon Interview | Set 5
       </h2><p>
     Ive attended the Amazon interview in Hyderabad, This was kindle team, I got rejected but Id like to share the experience, thought of giving back something to geeksforgeeks, which was a great reference for me.
     <span id="more-23453">
     </span>

     <br/>
     Very straight forward
     <br/>
     <strong>
      1.
     </strong>
     Given a linked list, sort without extra space.
     <br/>
     I wrote merge sort
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      2.
     </strong>
     Methods to serialize &amp; deserialize a tree ,must complete the below 2 monthods. File serialize (node *root) &amp; node * deserialize(File f)

    </p><p>
     <strong>
      First round
     </strong>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      1.
     </strong>
     Find diameter of a tree, Ive seen the question here, But i didnt recollect.. So solved my self..in some primitive way which made me write code with difficulty.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      2.
     </strong>
     Find a lowest common Ancestor, The variation was the tree was just a Binary Tree, Not BST, It was interesting to solve as i know only BST variation.

     <strong>
      Second round
     </strong>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      1.

     <br/>
     <strong>
      1.

          I got rejected in the last(6th) hiring manager round.
          <br/>
          I was asked about the same thing that muzicgod was asked regd the challenges and the worst part is that he didnt accept my answer for that question. The rest of the 5th tech rounds i got a feed back that i did well…
         </p><p>
          written test ques 2 ,it was for general tree or binary tree?
         </p><p>
          And in the island question you have to find number of islands or you have to output the co-ordinates which the island form or the largest island?Please clarify
          <br/>
          Thanks
         </p><p>
          I got rejected after 5 rounds same team an year back. I answered all problems excellently..
          <br/>
          May be the video round with hiring manager non tech part might be blockrr…

          how to solve q.2 in written test
         </p><p>
            To serialize, store inorder and preorder traversals of tree in file.
            <br/>
            To deserialize, read inorder and preorder traversals and construct the tree using

             this
            </a>
           </p><p>
              @karthik, No need to store inorder &amp; pre order,
              <br/>
              Only pre-order will do, here is an interesting approach :
              <a href="http://www.leetcode.com/2010/09/serializationdeserialization-of-binary.html" rel="nofollow">
               http://www.leetcode.com/2010/09/serializationdeserialization-of-binary.html
              </a>
              <br/>
              More Interesting is for a BST. Refer the same link above
             </p><p>
          For the first problem, merge sort uses an auxiliary array to do the merge operation. For a linked list, insertion sort or bubble sort might be better since they only deal with swap of adjacent pointers.
         </p><p>
            AFAIK Merge Sort is the best choice for Linked Lists.  It doesnt need extra space for array.  See
            <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/archives/7740" rel="nofollow">
             this for implementation of merge sort for linked list
            </a>
            .  Also see

          How did you solve the Island problem?
         </p><p>
            i think bfs should be fine ….
           </p><p>
              It is a standard Graph problem: Find all connected components in a graph.
             </p><p>
          Amazon selection process is random.  Their interviewers have a particular solution in mind and they expect you to write that solution only.
         </p><p>
            I dont think this is correct. I am not criticizing your view.
           </p><p>
            I had chat with few friends working in AMZ, and in common they said, "matter of luck is myth, if you deserve … you will surely make it".
           </p><p>
            Practice, clarity of thought, perfection in code, handling all error possibilities, design skills, approach towards abstract problem, these are some of qualities they look for.
           </p><p>
            Sometimes, few rounds are quite fast/rash, may be that is part of selection process.

     </strong>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      2)
     </strong>
     I gave the following solution (with the help of the interviewer):
    </p><p>
     1. For every set, find out the number of sets it has intersection with. Also maintain those set indices.
    </p><p>
     2. Remove the set which has maximum number of intersection. And update the remaining numbers.
    </p><p>
     3. Repeat step 2 till we have any set which has intersection with any other set. At the end, we will have the solution. (Still not sure about optimality).
    </p><p>
     We can relate the solution with graphs: Remove some nodes so that remaining all the nodes are isolated nodes.
    </p><p>
     Searching: To make searching efficient, we can build trie data structure using bits for every set. So that we can find the intersections fasters.
    </p><p>
     <br/>

     <strong>
      Face-to-face Interview 2 (with a manager):
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      1)
     </strong>
     I tried for some time. Then the interviewer gave me the formula. The number is 1+ceil((N-W)/S) in all the cases.
    </p><p>
     For second part of question, simple solution is to find min in every window. But we can optimize so that we can utilize previous results/previous min.
    </p><p>
     <em>
      Bit optimal:
     </em>
     I created a min-heap of W elements. But the heap contained indices of the array elements, not the values inside the array itself. The indices were stored in heap as per their values in the array. Then for a new window, search the heap linearly (heap was in form of array), replace the old indices (which are no longer in the new window) with the new indices, and adjust that index in the heap. After adjusting all the new indices, we will have new min for the new window at the root. (Not sure whether the complexity brought in to the solution is worth!)

          good to see answers posted

          " Given N sets of integers, remove some sets so that the remaining all sets are disjoint with one another. Find the optimal solution  so that the number of sets remaining at the end is maximum. "
         </p><p>
          This is equivalent to the vertex cover problem , so the optimal solution will have exponential time complexity . The solution you gave is nothing but a simple greedy approximation to the above.
         </p><p>
            It is different from vertex cover.  The vertex cover means include every vertex, here it is not all, but maximum.
           </p><p>
              Nope ,
              <br/>
              A Vertex Cover of a Graph is a set of vertices such that each edge of the graph is incident to at least one vertex of the set.
             </p><p>
              Now in this problem , you have to remove sets in such a way that number of sets remaining in the end is maximum — OR in other words — you have to remove the minimum number of sets , (which cover all edges ). Hence the minimum vertex cover problem.
             </p><p>
          thank you very much Hitesh

     <strong>
      Round 1:
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Question 1:-
     </strong>
     Given a 2D array containing only 0/1s and each row is in sorted order. Find the row which contains maximum number of 1s.
     <br/>
     I was asked to code. Algo which I told was I will search position of first 1 in 1st row using binary search. And mark it. Now note that position check in 2nd row. If there is 1 for that position already found in 1st row, then binary search from 0 to that position else move to row number 3. Similarly continue further.
    </p><p>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Round 2:-
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Question 1:-
     </strong>
     Given a Binary tree and two nodes. Need to find the minimum ancestor, no parent nodes given.
     <br/>
     Each time when I told answer, they modified question little bit or removed some extra storage which I was taking.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Question 2:-
     </strong>
     Given a Binary tree and two nodes. Need to find smallest path between them
    </p><p>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Round 3:-
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Question 1:-
     </strong>
     Given an array of infinite size containing 0/1 only and in sorted order, find position of first one.
    </p><p>
     My answer: first check whether 1 is present at 100th position or not if there, do binary search between 0 and 100 else check 1 is there at 200th position, and similarly continue further.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Question 2:-
     </strong>
     Given life time of different elephants find period when maximum number of elephants lived. ex [5, 10], [6, 15], [2, 7]  etc.  year in which max no elephants exists.
    </p><p>
     Other questions were regarding Operating system like virtual memory etc.
    </p><p>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Round 4:-
     </strong>
     <br/>
     It was HR round. Questions related to project. Questions like why I should Hire you etc were asked.
    </p><p>
     Result is still on wait.

          For elephant question —  Maintain a map and for each period, iterate from begin to end and increment the corresponding key in  map. Return the key with the max value. Correct me if I am wrong
         </p><p>
            I didnt get this elephant question exactly..i googled a lot but it shows maximum of first,min of second is answer…this is a nice question..so ,i request author,GFG to post some examples here so that we can find the strategy  to be used for this
           </p><p>
          For elephant question wat will be answer for [1,2] [3,4] [5,6]
         </p><p>
          2-5 as per comments below
          <br/>
          But it ill have only one elephant and 1-6 have 3 elephants,
          <br/>
          @anyone Pleae clarify its answer and aproach
         </p><p>
          wat do u  mean by minimum  ancestor ? least common ancestor ???
         </p><p>
          In round 2 Ques 1: The given tree is a binary tree or binary search tree??
         </p><p>
          Also can you give insight on  what solutions you had given and what expectations he had put for question1) round2, this will help us to know in what direction to prepare on answering any algo question
         </p><p>
          in  round 3 question 1, shouldnt be do binary search on whole array for 1st position of one instead of doing it in steps of 100 ?
         </p><p>
            See
            <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/archives/12281" rel="nofollow">
             this fact
            </a>
            <a>
             .
            </a>
           </p><p>
            We have discussed this question here,
           </p><p>
            <a href="http://geeksforgeeks.org/forum/topic/amazon-interview-question-7" rel="nofollow">
             http://geeksforgeeks.org/forum/topic/amazon-interview-question-7
            </a>
           </p><p>
          Can you please elaborate question 2 in round 3:
         </p><p>
          " Given life time of different elephants find period when maximum number of elephants lived. ex [5, 10], [6, 15], [2, 7] etc. year in which max no elephants exists. "
         </p><p>
            I think the question is about finding the period in which maximum number of elephants were present live.  In the given example, answer should be [6, 7], all three elephants were alive in this period.
           </p><p>
              how to find it using an algorithm??
             </p><p>
                Find biggest number in first elemets of set and lowest number in second element of set.
               </p><p>
                  No,this approach is wrong.
                  <br/>
                  consider the periods {(3,10,(5,8),(6,9),(10,20),(15,18),(16,18),16,17)}..
                  <br/>
                  your approach will output (16,8),which is wrong..
                  <br/>
                  Correct interval is (16,17) in which 4 elephants were alive..
                 </p><p>
            I think this can be achieved by searching highest values in first element of set i.e 6 and lowest values in second element of set i.e 7. Correct me if I am wrong.
           </p><p>
              I think the answer is [min of first values,max of second values]
             </p><p>
                sorry i misread the question its not correct
               </p><p>
            How about using hash?
           </p><p>
            Time being in a range.
            <br/>
            If [6,10] Increase the hash value by 1 for all hash with index 6-10. Likewise [2,5]. At the end we will return the index for which value of hash is maximum. Max_Index is the time for which maximum elephants were alive.
           </p><p>
            To find time period range, linearly find the time-period range with hash value equal to Max_Index

     <br/>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Interview Round 1(50 mins)
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Question 1:
     </strong>
     You are given two linked lists whose nodes contain a digit as data member. Both lists represent a number. You have to add them and return the resultant list.
     <br/>
     Input: 9-&gt;9-&gt;3-&gt;4-&gt;5 and 8-&gt;9-&gt;1 (represent 99345 and 891)
     <br/>
     Output: 1-&gt;0-&gt;0-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;6
     <br/>
     <em>
      My Solution:
     </em>
     Reverse the linked lists. Create the new sum list which is reversed. Finally reverse the resultant list.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Question 2:
     </strong>
     Interviewer asked to solve the above question without changing the original lists.
     <br/>
     <em>
      My Solution:
     </em>
     Count number of nodes in both lists. If equal then simply add two lists recursively. If not then advance a temp ptr which is a pointer to head of larger list by diff of nodes and then add the list pointed by temp and list 2. Make sure to keep track of carry. Add recursively. Propagate the carry in remaining elements of larger list. Was asked to code. Coded it.
    </p><p>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Interview Round 2(60 mins)
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Question 1:
     </strong>
     Delete nth node from end of a linked list in a single scan.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Question 2:
     </strong>
     In a linked list, in addition to the next ptr, a random ptr is also present. Clone the linked list.
     <br/>
     Did it in O(n) but by modifying the linked list and then restoring it. Was asked to do it without making any modifications in the original list. Did that in O(n^2)
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Question 3:
     </strong>
     Two nodes of a BST are given. Print the path from 1st node to the 2nd node. You are also provided the parent pointers in addition to normal left and right pointers.
    </p><p>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Interview Round 3(1 hour)
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Question 1:
     </strong>
     An array of n integers is there in which the range of elements is n, i.e., the difference between maximum and minimum number is n. Find the repeating numbers.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Question 2:
     </strong>
     An extension of Question 1. Was asked to find number of times each number is repeated.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Question 3:
     </strong>
     There are n frames of m data element each. The data element in each frame is arranged in increasing order. You are provided m*n space in which you have to arrange all data in increasing order.
    </p><p>
     My 1st solution was to use merge sort. He modified the question as only O(n) space is there and you need to send data in increasing order as fast as you can.
     <br/>
     My 2nd solution was to use min heap and construct it with the 1st element of all n frames. Min heap also contains extra field which signifies the frame number of data elements. This data structure can do the needful.
    </p><p>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Interview Round 4(1 hour)
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Question 1:
     </strong>
     Replace each element of an array with its greatest next integer in O(n).
     <br/>
     I couldnt do it. I tried but it didnt click. Not expected when you are in your last round.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Question 2:
     </strong>
     Reverse every k nodes of a linked list.
    </p><p>
     Well did that but was not finally selected…….

            Que 2:)
           </p><p>
          For telephone interview 2, question 2: why not use a max heap
          <br/>
          since you are interested in the k max items? With a max
          <br/>
          heap, the max item will be at the root of the tree and
          <br/>
          so k extract-max operations would be needed to answer
          <br/>
          the question.
         </p><p>
          Seems easier than with a min heap.
         </p><p>
            The min heap based method is more efficient than the max heap method. See time complexities of both methods

            And try and add the concept of "How to find a universal sink?" in O(V) time to improve on the above solution.
           </p><p>
          In telephonic int 1 q1 for what data type we need to implement?
          <br/>
          for int/float/double

          How did you solve question 3 in F2F 3?
         </p><p>
            make a new array where all elements are square of the old array, and then find three number in the new array such that a+b-c=0. Check the problem "find three number in an array where the sum is equal to something"
           </p><p>
              I think in case of quadratic array we can do additional deductions vs non quadratic
             </p><p>
                I mean we have additional information, that all items are positive for quadratic array
               </p><p>
            I dont remember much.  Started with a simple solution.  Finally settled with a hash based solution.

    </p><p>
     <strong>
      1)
     </strong>
     Given a Singly Linked List which contains integers, bring odd values in the beginning and even values at the end. The relative order of odd values, and that of even values should be maintained as it is.

     <strong>
      Face-to-face Interview 2 (with a manager):
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      1)
     </strong>
     Given an array of size N, a window of size W slides over it by increment of slide S. If the window reaches to the end, we should stop there. Find a formula in form of N, S, W so that we can find the number of valid windows. Write a program to find minimum in every window and print it. Optimize it.
    </p><p>
     e.g. {1,2,3,4,5}, W=2, S=1
     <br/>
     first window: {1,2} min=1
     <br/>
     second window(increment by S=1): {2,3}, min=2
    </p><p>
     …
    </p><p>
     last window: {4,5}, min=4
     <br/>
     The array might not be sorted. I have taken sorted array for simplicity.

      Face-to-face Interview 3:
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      1)
     </strong>
     Trim the Given BST by given min and max values. It means remove the nodes which have values less than min or greater than max. Write iterative and recursive – both the solutions.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      2)
     </strong>
     Given an array of strings, find the string which is made up of maximum number of other strings contained in the same array.
    </p><p>
     e.g. "rat", "cat", "abc", "xyz", "abcxyz", "ratcatabc", "xyzcatratabc"
     <br/>
     Answer: "xyzcatratabc"
     <br/>
     "abcxyz" contains 2 other strings,
     <br/>
     "ratcatabc" contains 3 other strings,
     <br/>
     "xyzcatratabc" contains 4 other strings
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      3)
     </strong>
     Find integer value of sqrt(N). Do not use any library functions or any mathematical solution.
    </p><p>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Face-to-face Interview 4 (with the manager of the unit of opening):
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      1)
     </strong>
     Given a 2-dimensional array of integers, find the value 1 in the array, and set all those rows, and columns to 1, which contains one of the values as 1.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      2)
     </strong>
     Suppose you are working in companies like naukri.com. You need to collect email Ids and contact numbers of all the Software Engineers aged between 25 to 40, in India. How will you do that?
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      3)
     </strong>
     Suppose a person of the age of your grandfather works on computer. He knows little about the computer. And he complains that it was working fine, but for last 2 days, it has become very slow. How will you solve it? What could be the reasons?
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      4)
     </strong>
     Design an IVR system for a Restaurant in which customers can book their tables for lunch and/or dinner. Advance booking for 2 or 7 days/as you wish. After the request from user, respond to him that you will confirm the request within 5 minutes. Check availability and send SMS confirming the same. If the SMS is delivered then assume that the customer is genuine. If the SMS is not delivered properly, discard the user request, as it is not genuine.
     <br/>
     i)       How can you take names and email Ids of the customers during the process?
     <br/>
     ii)     What can you do for repeat customers? How will you identify the repeat customers?
     <br/>
     iii)   If there is request for a team size greater than the table size, what will you do? E.g. request for 10 persons when table sizes are 6, 4 and 2.

          For ques 1,
          <br/>
          We can apply dynamic programming like in palindrome partition .Except find the maximum cuts such that each is a word.Complexity O(n^3*m) n is the length of largest and m is the number of strings.I think it can be reduced to O(n^2*m) though.
         </p><p>
            We can do it in linear time.
           </p><p>
            I had done it by splitting (split() method) the string in Java. However, we can simply do it by our code also.
           </p><p>
              Can you please shed some light on your solution?I am not able to figure out the linear time algorithm.
             </p><p>
                See jinus code below.
               </p><p>
                  I am sorry,i referred to the wrong question.I was talking about the face2face rnd 3
                  <br/>
                  ques 2
                 </p><p>
          How are sets given in ques 2?Is it given  in form of intervals?
         </p><p>
          For Ques 1,I think it can be done using dynamic programming.
          <br/>
          First put all the strings to a map.And then find the maximum number of cuts in the word such that each is a word.(Like in palindrome partition problem .It can be modified).so it will be O(n^3*m) where n is the length of each word and m is the number of strings.For better and early results.We can start from the longest word and stop if the length of the current word &lt;=maximum number of cuts so far.

         </p><p>
          1)     Given an array of strings, find the string which is made up of maximum number of other strings contained in the same array.
         </p><p>
          e.g. "rat", "cat", "abc", "xyz", "abcxyz", "ratcatabc", "xyzcatratabc"
          <br/>
          Answer: "xyzcatratabc"
          <br/>
          "abcxyz" contains 2 other strings,
          <br/>
          "ratcatabc" contains 3 other strings,
          <br/>
          "xyzcatratabc" contains 4 other strings
         </p><p>
          2)     Given N sets of integers, remove some sets so that the remaining all sets are disjoint with one another. Find the optimal solution so that the number of sets remaining at the end is maximum.
         </p><p>
            Question 2 is a variation of Activity selection problem.
           </p><p>
              Question 1 also seems variation of
              <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/archives/18528" rel="nofollow">
               activity selection problem
              </a>
              .
             </p><p>
              1) Sort individual strings.
              <br/>
              2) Find the set with maximum number of nonoverlapping strings
             </p><p>
              I dont think that it is a variation of activity selection problem . Can you explain any solution better than the exponential one ??

          Dude,
         </p><p>
          You were rocking in the interview, I donot think that they should reject you just because you knew the question beforehand, instead they could have asked you a different question,I hope they prepared far less that you were. I have a telephonic round day after, can you suggest some tips for that? Will be greatful to you….
         </p><p>
          Thanks,

          they wanted to see your thinking ability but you told them you already know questions. So they couldnt find the ability of solving those questions yourself in you.

            Dude, you are not allowed to make or use BST. Its just a simple array.
           </p><p>
          Round 2 Question 1 solution provided doesnt cater the case when the two nodes doesnt that add upto K doesnt form a child parent relationship.
         </p><p>
            Srikant, I didnt get your point. But I feel like solution will work with any relationship with any distance between nodes.
            <br/>
            Can you please educate your question?
           </p><p>
          Can u explain "Given array, find all possible sets of elements which add up to a given integer K.".
          <br/>
          Did they ask for all 2 element pairs or a pair can have more than 2 elements?
         </p><p>
            Srikant, it is not pairs. Output sets can have any number of elements which follow the condition with K.
           </p><p>
            e.g {1, 0, -1, 1} K = 0
            <br/>
            output will be {{1,0,-1}, {0}, {-1, 1} }
           </p><p>
            Well you can exclude the set {0, -1, 1} for an obvious reason.
           </p><p>
            It called subset sum problem..its already on geeksforgeeks
           </p><p>
          in Round 2 Qs 3 by pair do u mean pair of two or all possible sets?
         </p><p>
            Sorry for confusion dude,
            <br/>
            Its pair of two number. and find all possible unique pairs.
           </p><p>
          thanx for sharing ur experiences…..seems very useful for us..
         </p><p>
          Hi Vinay
         </p><p>
          You were not selected because u mentioned that u already knew the answers to many of the questions and they felt u were prepared thoroughly for Amazon.
          <br/>
          The problem was that, u were familiar with the problems they were asking and so, they were not able to judge your exact problem solving skills which is must requirement for Amazon. They must have thought, if you will come across a completely new problem, u wont be able to attack that. Only this might be the case u werent selected i suppose.What say ?
          <br/>
          THis is always with big names(Amazon,Adobe,MS etc).So in future, pretend as if u are hearing the problem for the first time and start the solution with basic approaches first and then try to move on to the best approach u know.
          <br/>
          (Saying all this with experience :P)
          <br/>
          Hope this helps u in future.
          <br/>
          Thanks Anyways.
         </p><p>
            Hey Vaibhav,
            <br/>
            Thanks for suggestions. Ill think about it.
           </p><p>
          Hi,
         </p><p>
          What did u answer for onsite 1b ??
          <br/>
          A large number stored in file cant be stored using any data type. Did u use linked list representation and then performed the addition ?
         </p><p>
          I dont think it is a general pattern
         </p><p>
          For the onsite round 2,encoding of the array.
         </p><p>
          we can have the two variables max and min and while going through the array consider the elements between them.
          <br/>
          max=INT_MAX
          <br/>
          min=INT_MIN
          <br/>
          if the number is outside the range continue with the next element.if the current is less than the given element write 0 and update the minimum else write 1 and update the maximum.
          <br/>
          complexity is O(n).
         </p><p>
            @sachin,
            <br/>
            that would work but I think you still need to refine your solution a bit.
            <br/>
            This is how I approached. Its pretty much similar to what you are trying to do.
           </p><p>
            prev = the numbers before this number, we dont need to care. Means the last decisive tree node.
            <br/>
            curr = current visiting element of the array.
            <br/>
            K = given number A[k]. (Assuming number is present in the array).
           </p><p>
            Now while going through array.
           </p><p>
            if prev &gt; curr &amp;&amp; K &gt; curr: discard curr, continue.
            <br/>
            if prev &lt; curr &amp;&amp; K  curr &amp;&amp; curr &lt;= K): print(0)
           </p><p>
            if ( prev = K): print (1)
           </p><p>
            prev = curr;
            <br/>
            curr = next number;
           </p><p>
            time complexity O(n);
           </p><p>
              thanks for the comment.Can you please explain ques 3 (SET question) with an example what needs to be done.
             </p><p>
                Seems like my above comment is deprecated and is not same as I commented. So only those conditions are not right.
               </p><p>
                about SET question, if array is {2,1,3,2,3,2,2,2}
                <br/>
                output should be
               </p><p>
                (1,2),(1,3), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3)
               </p><p>
                Order does not matter.
               </p><p>
                approached with space and without space.
                <br/>
                with space use Hash or dictionary(c#)
               </p><p>
                without space
                <br/>
                Sort the array
               </p><p>
                and print the sets with two loops. Sorting will give easy way to take care of duplicates
               </p><p>
                O(n^2)
               </p><p>
                Can do better to bring all unique numbers ahead and remaining in the end in O(n). Now print the tuples.

          hi vinay
          <br/>
          was it for SDE 1 position ad how many years of experience do u have?
         </p><p>
            @Mohit,
            <br/>
            I forgot to ask that question and neither they mentioned to me about SDE1 or SDE2. I am just two and half years experienced.
           </p><p>
          Hey Guys,
         </p><p>
          I just got my feedback, and they said it was very close call, and they extended discussion as well. But unfortunately they could not hire me this time, because I could not do one question on the spot and did after the interview. Well from the call I just got it.
          <img alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" src="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif"/>
         </p><p>
          @decoder, no I am just holding bachelor degree. I didnt feel any toughness in the interview though. Everything was normal.
         </p><p>
          @vin, I asked them as well if they want me to explain the algos and codes as well. I did when they said so as well.
         </p><p>
          @Vinay,
         </p><p>
          Are you a Ph.D student ? I dont think, they ask such tough question to undergraduates in interview.
         </p><p>
            i dont think so….it is a general pattern.
           </p><p>
          Probably the mistake you may have made is telling you knew the questions!!!
         </p><p>
            Concur with this. Many people strongly advice to say that you know a problem. But in my personal experience it is better to sit back and show that you are thinking and come up with the solution, instead of saying you know the problem.

        Amazon Interview | Set 8
       </h2><p>
     I recently interviewed with amazon for the position of SDE1 in their TRMS team. The interview procedure was unimaginable rigorous.
     <span id="more-26879">
     </span>
    </p><p>
     Here are the details
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Round 0: Written Round
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     Interviewstreet Test – 2 questions to be done in 2 hours
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Q1
     </strong>
     : Calculate the expression (2+3)*5 .. The question just said this .. I guess we had to make our own assumptions to solve the problem
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Q2
     </strong>
     : Two trees can be called isomorphic if they have similar structure and the only difference amongst them can be is, that their child nodes may or may not be swaped..
    </p><p>
     for example
    </p><p>
     ——4
    </p><p>
     —-2—6
    </p><p>
     –1–3–5–7
    </p><p>
     and
    </p><p>
     ——4
    </p><p>
     —-6—2
    </p><p>
     –1–3–7–5
    </p><p>
     are isomorphic .. the trees are similar and a few nodes have their left and right child swapped…
    </p><p>
     Given two trees determine if they are isomorphic…
    </p><p>
     The interviewstreet people marked the solution to my first question wrong even when it worked fine.. When I told the HR about the situation, she got it checked with some of the amazon guys and they were ok with it.
    </p><p>
     I cleared the written test.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Telephonic Interview 1
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Q1
     </strong>
     : Find the Kth largest integer in a Binary Search Tree. When I told her the solution like the one given on geeks for geeks, she asked me to do it using recursion.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Q2
     </strong>
     : Given an array of positive integers, find the max no that can be formed by any permutation of the arrangement. I told her a logic. She then asked me to write just the comparison function to choose one number to put before the other.
    </p><p>
     When I gave the interviewer straight answers, she twisted the question more.. Probably they wanted to see how i think and approach a problem.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Telephonic Interview 2
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Q1
     </strong>
     : A binary search tree is given with its two nodes interchanged. I had to find both the nodes.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Q2
     </strong>
     : Identify all the pythagorian triplets in the given array.
    </p><p>
     I cleared this round. The HR told me I had to come over to Bangalore for in-person interviews. (all the travel arrangements were made by amazon itself)
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Personal Interview 1
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Q1
     </strong>
     : Find the sum of continuous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers which has the largest sum .. I didnt know a solution (kadanes algorithm), but somehow I was able to work it out in the interviews ..the interviewer liked my way of approaching and did help a little
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Q2
     </strong>
     : How can you best implement queues using stacks. What would be the time complexity?
    </p><p>
     was able to do this one quickly.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Personal Interview 2
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Q1:
     </strong>
     Find non-unique characters in a given string. I told her one O(n^2) [brute force], one O(n logn) [sort and then compare adjacent elements], and one O(n) [store the character count in an array] approach. She then asked me to do it in O(n) without using array.
    </p><p>
     Clueless, she finally told me she wanted me to use BIT Vector. I wasnt well converse with Bit Vectors and I told her so.. She still asked me think more. Finally she told me a solution using the same which was impossible to think in the interview alone, especially when one didnt know what BIT Vectors were. She agreed when I stated the point and accepted my previous O(n) solution and we proceeded to the next question.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Q2:
     </strong>
     Given an array of integers, populate another array with the product of the  elements of the first array except for the current index element.
    </p><p>
     Here when I gave her a O(n) solution [find product and divide it with current element to get the number for this index position], she asked me to do it without the divide operator. Gave her a O(n^2) solution. But I couldnt think better. Finally just when she began to tell me an O(n) approach, I remembered the geeksforgeeks solution to the problem  and gave it to her. Probably she didnt consider it. (dont know for sure)
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Personal Interview 3
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     This interview was with the hiring manager at Amazon. He first asked me a couple of HR questions like Why Amazon? Why should we hire you? Projects, internships etc ..? How would you handle a disagreement with your team mates? Etcetc …
    </p><p>
     Then he asked me a programming question.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Q
     </strong>
     : He drew a circle on the board and marked a few points on it. Named them X1, X2, X3 ..
    </p><p>
     Then he said these are gas stations, and you have to find the correct gas station from where a car should begin to loop in the circle such that it never runs out of gas before completing a round. He then sat on the table.
    </p><p>
     (Sorry, but I will have to describe it in detail to tell you how it was put out to me.. and off-course to bring in more clarity to the question itself.. )
    </p><p>
     Unclear about what I had to do exactly and what information was available, I asked him back a few questions.
    </p><p>
     Why will car run out of gas after fuelling from lets say the first gas station?
    </p><p>
     He said each gas station has limited amount of gas (lets say X1) and after fueling from this station it can run out of gas even before reaching the next station (anything could happen, it may be able to cross the next gas station but run out later before completing the round..).   So I have to find a gas station the car should start the loop from such that it never runs out of gas before completing the loop.
    </p><p>
     So can the car refuel at the next available gas station, if its able to make up to it?
    </p><p>
     Yes
    </p><p>
     Do we have the information about the amount of gas required to reach from one petrol pump to another?
    </p><p>
     Yes
    </p><p>
     I made an assumption that the car tank was huge enough to fill as much gas as possible.
    </p><p>
     And then I drew two arrays, one holding the amount of gas each station had, and other the amount of gas needed to go from this station to the next station..
    </p><p>
     Fuel Available: X1, X2, X3, X4, X5
    </p><p>
     Fuel Required to reach next station: Y1, Y2, Y3, Y4, Y5
    </p><p>
     He said ok, and asked me to go ahead.
    </p><p>
     I then took the difference (Y1-X1), (Y2-X2) ..and stored it in an array.. and then suddenly  it hit me that this became a simple problem of finding the maximum sum of a continuous subarray within an array (circular). He liked my approach and asked me to program it. Did it and showed him a dry run of the code I had written.  He was ok with it.
    </p><p>
     (I felt good after the interview because in there I didnt stumble at all ..)
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Personal Interview 4
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Q1:
     </strong>
     We have a huge file with braces ‘() [just one type..] Find if they are balanced ..  (stacks wouldnt work here because you will probably run out of memory storing the stack ..) When I gave him another solution, he asked me to do it using parallel processes. I told him to elaborate more.. (to be honest I wasnt familiar with parallel processes) .. Finally I told him so ..and he asked me to think about it still ..
    </p><p>
     We discussed it for about 20 minutes. Not reaching anywhere he moved on to ask me the next question.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Q2
     </strong>
     : Find the smallest substring which contains all the characters of the main string. Again I dint have a solution to this. I gave him a O(n^2) approach. He asked me to think further because the way I was approaching it was the way to go about it and I can make use of the last sub-solution obtained to improve my complexity. Couldnt think of anything, we finally moved on to the third question.
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Q3
     </strong>
     : given the numerator and denominator of a fraction, find the quotient and the remainder without using divide and mod (‘/, % )operators. This was simple. I did it. He then asked to write the invariant of my solution which was denominator*quotient + remainder = numerator.
    </p><p>
     He then asked me to think about the cases when either or both of numerator and denominator were negative. We were almost out of time so he didnt give me time to think and concluded the interview. He wanted me write an invariant that was true regardless of the input. Now that I think of it, I should have said |denominator|*quotient + remainder = |numerator|

     Flew back home in the night.

     2 Days later the HR informed me that I didnt make it in.

     This was probably the most difficult of all the interviews I have ever had.

     Hope it helps some of you ..

          Implementing queues with stacks!
          <br/>
          Do share what was the complexity of push and pop operation in the queues implemented. Were they both of the order O(1) ?
         </p><p>
            yep O(1) push and pop .. except for the occasional expensive pop operation (O(n)) most push and pop would be O(n)
           </p><p>
              sorry for the typo in my last comment
             </p><p>
              yep O(1) push and pop .. except for the occasional expensive pop operation (O(n)) most push and pop would be "O(1)"

          Hi,
         </p><p>
          For the phone interviews, do they share something where we have to write code ?? like Google docs or something.
          <br/>
          Or do they have to read our code to them over phone.
          <br/>
          I am asking this for any general Amazon phone interview.
         </p><p>
            that really depends on the interviewer .. for me that asked me to dictate my code over the phone ..
           </p><p>
          ganglu Will they call me if my first solution is correct and in second my solution passes 4/7 test case.. questions were same..
         </p><p>
            sorry for answering this late .. probably you know by now .. but to answer your question, nope they wont …

          one question for all of you ..
          <br/>
          what is your opinion of the interviews i had ..
          <br/>
          were they easy, hard, average, ok .. ?
          <br/>
          please give a honest reply . it will help me set standards for my future preperation ..
         </p><p>
            There are very few companies that take interviews as rigorous as this for entry level…so I would definitely rate it as hard…
           </p><p>
            It seems tough for freshers.
           </p><p>
          I think he wanted to speedup the process by multithreading. The solution is straightforward.
         </p><p>
          For e.g:
         </p><p>
          (((())))
         </p><p>
          Read group of 4 characters
         </p><p>
          Follow above algorithm thread1 will return 4 and thread2 will return -4 sum the two threads output 0.
         </p><p>
            read my follow up comment for HLS Nirma ..
           </p><p>
            any thoughts .. ?
           </p><p>
          Round 4, Question 1 solution is as follows:
         </p><p>
            yeah this was my second solution after stacks and he accepted it.. he then asked me to do it using parallel processes ..  any idea about tht .. ?
           </p><p>
              I think he wanted to speedup the process by multithreading. The solution is straightforward.
             </p><p>

              Follow above algorithm thread1 will return 4 and thread2 will return -4 sum the two threads output 0.
             </p><p>
                consider a case like this ..
                <br/>
                (()))()(
               </p><p>
                like u said 2 thread .. reading 4 characters each ..
                <br/>
                thread 1 will output 0
                <br/>
                thread 2 will output 0
               </p><p>
                but parenthesis are not balanced. .. how to solve this anamoly .. i can think of more cases where this anamoly is handled by more than one threads .. how to deal with it then .. ?
               </p><p>
                  The threads will read 4 characters in turns. First4 by the 1st thread, next 4 by the 2nd ans so on. Here Thread 1 will give output 1 and Thread 2 will give 0.
                 </p><p>
          round 0:- quetion 2
         </p><p>
            u missed a condition … (this logic is for trees that are similiar ..)
           </p><p>
            if left left are not same .. left right can be same .. and that is fine ..
            <br/>
            it would be more like this ..
           </p><p>
          Personal Interview2,question1:
          <br/>
          As far as I understand,we have to print characters which occur more than once in String.
          <br/>
          Since in a bit vector, we can store only two values(0,1) so we can tell whether any specific character is present or not.
          <br/>
          So to print non-unique characters,requires at least 2 bit_vector.
         </p><p>
          2nd bit_vector is required to maintain information about duplicates.
         </p><p>
          Correct me If I am wrong, or any better solution than this.
         </p><p>
            yep ur right .. using bit vector i had to point out if there was  a duplicate … thats it ..!!!
           </p><p>
          Thanks very much for sharing.
          <br/>
          Can you please tell what alternative solution you gave for Personal Interview Round 4, Question 1?
         </p><p>
          Thanks
         </p><p>
            count no of open brackets .. add +1 if ‘(‘ subtract -1 if ‘) .. count should not go below ‘0 ..
           </p><p>
          For ques: Identify all the pythagorian triplets in the given array.
          <br/>
          I cant think of any solution with complexity less than O(n^2).
          <br/>
          I thought about few property like:
          <br/>
          1. x,y,z (x&lt;yz
          <br/>
          2. if x,y,z then kx,ky,kz (k is even) will also be a triplet.
          <br/>
          Any better solution…
         </p><p>
            This same as finding two numbers in array, there sum is equal to number , which is present in same array.
            <br/>
            Ex: a+b = c
            <br/>
            where a,b,c are from the same array arr[]
           </p><p>
            sort arr[] will work, over complexity will be nlogn  + n ==&gt; nlogn
           </p><p>
              yep right half way .. then u have to chose a hypotenuse and for that hypotenuse find a sum .. it makes the complexity O(n^2) .. correct me if i m wrong ..
             </p><p>
            yep .. i gave O(n^2) solution.. and he accepted it .. (sort, pick the hypotenuse, find the other two elements ..)
            <br/>
            Not sure if there is a better solution ..
           </p><p>
          can anyone provide one example for: Telephonic Interview1, ques 2.
         </p><p>
          can anyone give one example for: Telephonic interview1, question 2
         </p><p>
            if u have an array say 9, 21, 23 .. then the max no that can be formed is 92321 … get it .. ?
           </p><p>
          PI 2 – Q1 Is bit vector (bitmap) not itself an array ?
         </p><p>
            yep .. but she was looking for a specific solution .. how do u fight that with logic ..? ..
            <img alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" src="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif"/>
           </p><p>
              SPARTAAA !!!!
              <img alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" src="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif"/>
             </p><p>
          you were gng for fresher or experience  in amazon ?
         </p><p>
            fresher ..
           </p><p>
          You can do () thing without stack, just keep a variable called stack size, increment by 1 when you see ( and decrease by 1 when you see ).
          <br/>
          for isomorphic trees i think you can compare the nodes at each level, (sort and compare)
          <br/>
          for personal interview 4, question 2
          <br/>
          you can make the unique characters using the Bit Vector concept, and then can solve this is O(n) time.
         </p><p>
            yep .. that was my second solution for () .. and he accepted it .. we also agreed that this count can never go below zero ..
           </p><p>
            isomorphic .. yep comare left to left and right to right .. if that doesnt fit .. compare right to left and left to right and return the result to the nodes up in the hierachy .. i think someone might have already posted the code somewhere .. if not i ll post it myself ..
           </p><p>
            i stil havent thought of it … once i have a solution . i ll definitely post it ..
           </p><p>
          Thanks a lot for sharing ….
         </p><p>
          Can you please tell the full form of the abbreviation – TRMS ???
          <br/>
          I want to know the exact team name.
         </p><p>
            TRMS stands for transportation and matrices…its one of the biggest team in Amazon
           </p><p>
              I dont know about transportation and matrices… TRMS means Transaction risk management system …
              <br/>
              they code algorithms to detect risky and fraudelent transactions at amazon ..

          Round 0: Written Round
          <br/>
          ques 1) -&gt; so what was your approach to solve this question…did you first convert it into postfix notation and then solved this notation using stacks ?
         </p><p>
            yes that is one way of doing it .. i created a binary tree with operator on the root .. and numbers on both left and right child .. (in some cases expression down the tree) .. and then evaluated it ..

     Technical Interview
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Question 1:
     </strong>
     You are given a linked list and a parameter k. You will have to swap values in a certain fashion, swap value of node 1 with node k, then node (k+1) with node 2k and go on doing this in the similar fashion
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Question 2:
     </strong>
     For the above question, do it without swapping the values. If you want a swap to occur between two nodes, then you will have to move the nodes itself.

          I am surprised to see questions 1,2 and 3 in interview 2 and question 1 in interview 3 are so similar to each other. If you solved one of them, you would probably solves all of them.

          can we have a better approach than these,i mean linear search for each element-O(n^2)

              Hi,
             </p><p>
              Can you please explain the logic how u will solve next big element which is close. I tried using NGE. Thank you.
             </p><p>
                what does close mean here? number which is just greater than the element.

                ex.) if input is 4, 1, 6, 2, 5
                <br/>
                then output is 5, 2, -1, 5, -1
               </p><p>
                NGE output: 6, 6, -1, 5, -1

          @Jinendra For LIS problem, did you give the dynamic programming O(n^2) solution or the O(nlogn) solution?
         </p><p>
          hi can you tell me more about the aptitude questions
         </p><p>
          For PI, Are they asking the logic or to write the complete code?
         </p><p>
            First you have to tell them what are you going to do.Explain your logic and show them that it will give optimal result in all cases.Then they will make you write the code.Try to write a code with very few errors in first attempt.
           </p><p>
              Hi jinendra,
              <br/>
              did you have the onsite interviews in india or in seattle ? amazon(HQ)
             </p><p>
              Thank you!
             </p><p>
                i am a 4th year student of engineering in india.Amazon came to our campus for recruitment.
               </p><p>
                  Thats good.When it is coming.
                 </p><p>
              Do not you think it is quite small time to solve all the problems and then give them code also.
             </p><p>
              If I consider, if we can code in 10 mins then we left with 5 min to come with logic for each problem.
             </p><p>
              Whats your view on this?
             </p><p>
                If you want to get into companies like amazon microsoft then u will have to be that quick

          congrats Jinendra Baid      plz provide solution also
         </p><p>
            for interview 2 question 1 : i used a 2d matrix with two rows.all lengths in row1 and breadths in row 2. Sorted the row1 and arranged row2 with it accordingly ..now row1 is in increasing order,so we just need to find the longest incresing sequence in row 2
            <img alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" src="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif"/>
           </p><p>
              and to extend this to k dimensions represent each object as a node..now there is an edge from node i to node j if all dimensions of node i are smaller than that of j..now find the longest path length possible in that graph
              <img alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" src="http://d2o58evtke57tz.cloudfront.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif"/>
             </p><p>
                how to do for three dimensions ?
               </p><p>
                @Jinendra: in you k dimension approch…
                <br/>
                as we dont know the starting point if the node…we have to check each node and simply apply DFS to find longest path(considering unit of each path =1 ) ??
                <br/>
                am i correct!!
               </p><p>
                  I think the graph will be DAG… so you can easily find the longest path
                 </p><p>
              how about this approach for
              <br/>
              interview 2 question 1 :-
             </p><p>
              sort input on base of area (length *breath)
              <br/>
              now find LIS such that length(i) &gt;= length(j) and breath(i) &gt;= breath(j)
             </p><p>
          please can give codes for above problems
         </p><p>
          for question 1 round 3 ,can you please explain more about the quesion?
         </p><p>
            what are you not getting?? see if u have a pair (a,b)
            <br/>
            then a&lt;b for all pairs.if you want to conbine two pairs (a,b) and (c,d) then a&lt;b&lt;c&lt;d must be satisfied.in this manner we have to form a chain
           </p><p>
            /* Paste your code here (You may delete these lines if not writing code) */
           </p><p>
              In the question,it was not mentioned that a&lt;b .Please confirm if it is correct.
              <br/>
              Can input  be of form (5,3),(6,1),(2,4)?
              <br/>
              Thats why i was confused.

                @Jinendra
                <br/>
                In this question, did you solve it by creating a DAG and then finding the longest path or did you use some kind of LIS approach ?
               </p><p>
                  I think, it can be efficiently solved using LIS.
                 </p><p>
                  @Jinendra: Please confirm.
                 </p><p>
          i guess interviews loves LIS problems

        Count total set bits in all numbers from 1 to n
       </h2><p>
     Given a positive integer n, count the total number of set bits in binary representation of all numbers from 1 to n.

      Amazon Interview Question
     </a>
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Method 1 (Simple)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     A simple solution is to run a loop from 1 to n and sum the count of set bits in all numbers from 1 to n.
    </p><p>
     Output:
    </p><p>
     Time Complexity: O(nLogn)
    </p><p>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Method 2 (Tricky)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     If the input number is of the form 2^b -1 e.g., 1,3,7,15.. etc, the number of set bits is b * 2^(b-1). This is because for all the numbers 0 to (2^b)-1, if you complement and flip the list you end up with the same list (half the bits are on, half off).
    </p><p>
     If the number does not have all set bits, then some position m is the position of leftmost set bit. The number of set bits in that position is n – (1 &lt;&lt; m) + 1. The remaining set bits are in two parts:
    </p><p>
     1) The bits in the (m-1) positions down to the point where the leftmost bit becomes 0, and
     <br/>
     2) The 2^(m-1) numbers below that point, which is the closed form above.
    </p><p>
     An easy way to look at it is to consider the number 6:
    </p><p>
     The leftmost set bit is in position 2 (positions are considered starting from 0). If we mask that off what remains is 2 (the "1 0″ in the right part of the last row.) So the number of bits in the 2nd position (the lower left box) is 3 (that is, 2 + 1). The set bits from 0-3 (the upper right box above) is 2*2^(2-1) = 4. The box in the lower right is the remaining bits we havent yet counted, and is the number of set bits for all the numbers up to 2 (the value of the last entry in the lower right box) which can be figured recursively.
    </p><p>
     Time Complexity: O(Logn).  From the first look at the implementation, time complexity looks more. But if we take a closer look, statements inside while loop of getNextLeftmostBit() are executed for all 0 bits in n. And the number of times recursion is executed is less than or equal to set bits in n. In other words, if the control goes inside while loop of getNextLeftmostBit(), then it skips those many bits in recursion.

          can any one tell me when the while loop inside getNextLeftmostBit() will be execute ….. bcoz every time when we call this function it give same value of m
         </p><p>
            @admin , plz some one reply for this comment , i have same problem … thanks
           </p><p>
              It returns (m-1) always .. eg: for n=16, we get m = 5, from getLeftMostBit() method, In getNextLeftmostBit() , 2^5 = 32 which is ‘temp value, iterates once to give m=m-1; ( 16 &lt; 16 , fails )

          A simple algo would be to count it for each bit position. It will run in constant time. We just need to check how many 2^i pairs have occurred in ith position.  For eg. if on 3rd lsd 4 pairs of 4 has occured we just need to add 4*4/2 no. of 1s and move on. In case some remainder is left add that too if no of pairs is odd.

          Algo of method 2 is good but in the code of method 2 getNextLeftmostBit() is useless and why countSetBits() and _countSetBits() are used if we can achieve same only by _countSetBits().

          If the input number is of the form 2^b -1 e.g., 1,3,7,15.. etc, the number of set bits is b * 2^(b-1).
          <br/>
          this is incorrect

          if number is of the form 2^b -1 , the number of set bits is b.

          for this problem-we can do the following approach
          <br/>
          1)count the no of bits in the number-
          <br/>
          while(n)
          <br/>
          {
          <br/>
          n=n/2;

          count++;
          <br/>
          }
          <br/>
          2) return count+pow(2,count-1);

          A simple solution , using the fact that for the ith least significant bit, answer will be (N/2^i)*2^(i-1)+ X
          <br/>
          where X = N%(2^i) – (2^(i-1)-1) iff N%(2^i)&gt;=(2^(i-1)-1)
         </p><p>
            @Piyush Kapoor: Thanks for sharing your code. Your method looks better. We will add it to the original post.  It will helpful for us if you provide more explanation so that we can add the same with your approach.
           </p><p>
              Consider the ith least significant bit(1 based indexing) for numbers from 1 to N , then they repeat with a period equal to 2^i.And in the period , first half of the values are 0 and the next half are ones.For example :-
              <br/>
              For numbers from 0 to 7,(0 will contribute nothing so no effect)
              <br/>
              000
              <br/>
              001
              <br/>
              010
              <br/>
              011
              <br/>
              100
              <br/>
              101
              <br/>
              110
              <br/>
              111
              <br/>
              1st least significant bit = 01010101 Period=2
              <br/>
              2nd least significant bit = 00110011 Period=4
              <br/>
              3rd least significant bit = 00001111 Period=8
              <br/>
              and so on.
              <br/>
              So for the ith least significant bit ,answer will be (N/Period)*(Half of Period Size) + (N%Remainder – Half of Period Size)
              <br/>
              The second term will only be taken when N%Remainder is greater than or equal to Half of Period Size.
              <br/>
              Also , N%(2^i) can be written as N&amp;(2^i – 1)
             </p><p>
                A correction :
                <br/>
                Second Term in the answer is
                <br/>
                N%(2^i – 1) – Half of Period Size + 1
               </p><p>
                which is only taken when N%(2^i – 1) is greater than or equal to the (Half of Period Size – 1)
               </p><p>

     <strong>
      Question 1:
     </strong>
     There is a binary tree of size N. All nodes are numbered between 1-N(inclusive). There is a N*N integer matrix Arr[N][N], all elements are initialized to zero. So for all the nodes A and B, put Arr[A][B] = 1 if A is an ancestor of B (
     <strong>
      NOT
     </strong>
     just the immediate ancestor).
    </p><p>
     <strong>
      Question 2:

     <strong>
      Question 3:
     </strong>
     There is a N*N integer matrix Arr[N][N]. From the row r and column c, we can go to any of the following three indices:
    </p><p>
     I.                Arr[ r+1 ][ c-1 ] (valid only if c-1&gt;=0)
    </p><p>
     II.               Arr[ r+1 ][ c ]
    </p><p>
     III.              Arr[ r+1 ][ c+1 ] (valid only if c+1&lt;=N-1)
    </p><p>
     So if we start at any column index on row 0, what is the largest sum of any of the paths till row N-1.

     Interviewer asked HR Questions Initially, then a sort of puzzle.
    </p><p>
     Two robots land with their parachutes on an infinite one-dimensional number line. They both release their parachutes as soon as they land and start moving. They are allowed only to make use of the following functions.
    </p><p>
     I.                 moveLeft() // robot moves to left by 1 unit in 1 unit time
    </p><p>
     II.               moveRight() // robot moves to right by 1 unit in 1 unit time
    </p><p>
     III.              noOperation() // robot does not move and takes 1 unit time
    </p><p>
     IV.              onTopOfParachute() // returns true if the robot is standing on top of either of the parachute, else false
    </p><p>
     V.               didWeMeet() // returns true if the robot meets to the other robot, else false
    </p><p>
     Write a function in order to make the robots meet each other. Robots will be executing the same copy of this function.

      Tips / Advice:
     </strong>
    </p><p>
     I.                 Each time you write a code, check for the edge cases.
    </p><p>
     II.               Do not assume anything. Keep asking questions if there are any doubts.

          I understand we need to use postorder but not able to cover all the cases. Can someone suggest a good approach for this ?

          round 1 ques 2:
          <br/>
          O(logn)
         </p><p>
            assuming array is in ascending order
           </p><p>
          for round 3  question 1 ,
          <br/>
          since its a BINARY TREE we can maintain a stack ans push the elements  and before  recursing on its children  update each nodes ancestors by accessing the stack (pop and push)
         </p><p>
          is there any efficient approach ???

          @sriram:
          <br/>
          see in an array you can move either down,or diagonally left below,or diagonally right below starting from the first element.you need to find the maximum sum considering all possible choice of next element.
          <br/>
          r+1,c denotes element below the element r,c
          <br/>
          r+1,c+1 denotes element diagonally right &amp; below the element r,c

          Interview I round second question
          <br/>
          Let the array Length=l.
          <br/>
          Find the minimum element(i.e index i) in the given array
          <br/>
          then r=(l-i)%l;
          <br/>
          Time complexity: O(n)
          <br/>
          I think O(logn) solution may be possible.

          Interview Round 3, Question 3.
         </p><p>
          It can be done using Dynamic Programming.  Similar to
          <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/archives/14943" rel="nofollow">
           Min Cost Path
          </a>
         </p><p>
          We can reach a point from following 3 points
          <br/>
          1) The point just above
          <br/>
          2) The point which is left diaginally above
          <br/>
          3) The point which is right diaginally above
         </p><p>
          Solve the three subproblems and return the maximum of 3
         </p><p>
          Interview round 4. My idea for making robots meet is :
          <br/>
          a) follow this pattern, MoveLeft 1 time, MoveRight 2 times, MoveLeft 3 times, MoveRight 4 times and so on.
          <br/>
          b) In each iteration, the robot will go over its own parachute one time. But after certain time,  one robot will go over its parachute and also the other robots parachute. At this point, I stop this robot and continue with the other robot.
          <br/>
          c) Finally when this robot go over its own parachute, it meets the other robot
         </p><p>
            The approach is quite good but there are certain flaws in code.
            <br/>
            Increment i after one round so that next round number of left/right moves are incremented.
           </p><p>
            And last while loop containing continue is not proper.
           </p><p>
              oops..you are right..forgot to increment i after each round. that is a good catch.
             </p><p>
              regarding the last loop
              <br/>
              while(!didWeMeet()){
              <br/>
              continue;
              <br/>
              }
             </p><p>
              the first robot goes into this loop when twice = 2, and when the second robot meets the first one (meet = 1) , both exit at the same time. I think you are right..this is not necessary at all..thanks
             </p><p>
              My idea is:
              <br/>
              Move both robots in same direction (either left or right). Once a robot steps on a parachute, reverse the direction of other robot and let them meet. Done in O((distance between the two)*1.5).
             </p><p>
                my approach would be to move both the robot in opposite direction at the same time. cause a in a 1 d line the have to opposite each other.. in this case both will meet before they reach other s  parachute
               </p><p>
                my approach would be to move both the robots in opposite direction at the same time. cause  in a 1 d line they have to opposite each other(one to the left of other).. in this case both will meet before they reach other robot ‘s parachute
               </p><p>
            I had a different approach.
            <br/>
            Keep a flag whether the robot has reached the others parachute or not. If it has reached, call moveRight() two times, otherwise call moveRight() and noOperation().
            <br/>
            This way one robot will double its speed as soon as it reaches to the others parachute and eventually they will meet. Let me know please, if I need to post the code.
           </p><p>
              I have different approach. Please let me know your thoughts. call moveRight() until one of the robot  doesnt reach the others parachute. Set a flag after parachute is reached. Call moveLeft() on the second robot &amp; noOperation() on the first robot until they do not meet.
             </p><p>
              @Akash , yeah please post your code bro. And congrats.
             </p><p>
              we could do the 1st step(moving the robot) for both the robots simultaneously(but in opposite direction with respect to each other)in this way  they would eventually meet each other before they reach others parachute.correct me if i am wrong..
             </p><p>
              I dont think flags were allowed. Heres a  simple solution without a flag.
             </p><p>
              function(){
              <br/>
              while(!didWeMeet() &amp;&amp; !onTopParachute){
              <br/>
              moveRight();
              <br/>
              }
             </p><p>
              while(!didWeMeet())
              <br/>
              moveRight();
              <br/>
              moveRight();
              <br/>
              }
              <br/>
              }
             </p><p>
              The first loop is speed 1, and the second is speed 2. The robot that lands on the parachute escapes into loop2, while the first one is still moving at speed 1 in the first loop, trapped. Hence the faster robot will catch up.
             </p><p>
              No flags needed.
             </p><p>
                I think the code with this slight modification would work perfectly
               </p><p>
                function(){
                <br/>
                while(!didWeMeet() &amp;&amp; !onTopParachute){
                <br/>
                moveRight();
                <br/>
                noOperation()
                <br/>
                }
               </p><p>
                while(!didWeMeet())
                <br/>
                moveRight();
                <br/>
                moveRight();
                <br/>
                }
                <br/>
                }
               </p><p>
                The idea is kinda similar to the Tortoise and Hare algorithm.
               </p><p>
          Round 2: Question1 : what does top trending words mean ?
          <br/>
          The most frequently occurring words or most recently occurred words ? I dont think it would be the latter.
         </p><p>
            I think it means , words occurring most number of times. We have to maintain a count for each word and return the top 10 in sorted order of these counts.
           </p><p>
              Top trending word means, the word which has occurred the highest number of times so far.
             </p><p>

          Interview Round 2 -&gt;Question 3:
          <br/>
          how to do below operation in O(1) time :-
          <br/>
          1) Delete a given number(if it is present in the queue, else do nothing)
          <br/>
          2)isNumberPresent
         </p><p>
            just use doubly linked list and hashmap(which contains the addresses to the nodes) so that you can retrieve them in O(1)
            <br/>
            lets say delete 5
           </p><p>
            get hashmap[5] and rearrange the pointers
           </p><p>
              Did it the same way
